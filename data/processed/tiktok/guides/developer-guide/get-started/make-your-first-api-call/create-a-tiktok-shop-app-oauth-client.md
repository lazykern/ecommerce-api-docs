To make your first API call, you'll need a TikTok Shop App in order to request consent from a TikTok Seller and generate an access token. This is because a TikTok Shop App is an OAuth 2.0 client, and it's the entity that makes requests consent from a Seller or Creator to access their data. Once the Seller or Creator consents, the owner of the TikTok Shop App receives a credential in the form of an authorization code that they can then use to generate an access token and refresh token.
At this point of your getting started journey, you may not know all of the details required to create your TikTok Shop App.
If this is the case, you can create multiple TikTok Shop App. You can create a test TikTok Shop App for now, and create your real TikTok Shop App later. However, if you choose to create a test TikTok Shop App, you'll still have to pass all the TikTok Shop requirements to enable it. If this aligns with your getting started goals, you can continue with the steps in this tutorial.
If you do know all the details and want to create your final, release TikTok Shop App as part of getting started, you can take a deeper dive into the details in [TikTok Shop platform concepts](tts-platform-concepts). If this aligns with your getting started goals, return here and move ahead to the **next steps** section to create a test Seller account.
## Step 1: Select App & Service from the navigation panel
Log in to the [TikTok Shop Partner Center console](https://partner-sso.tiktok.com/account/login).

Select **App & Service** in the navigation panel.
## Step 2: Create your TikTok Shop App
Click the **Create app & service** button in the top right corner of the page.
You now have a choice to make: a **public** or **custom** app. A public app will be available for download from the TikTok Shop App Store and access the data of any TikTok Shop Seller or Creator that consents, but in order to be approved will have to meet a set of requirements. A custom app is not available for download from the TikTok Shop App store, but will only be able to access the data of the linked TikTok Shop Seller or Creator account.
## Step 3: Choose your service category
Select a **Service category** from the drop-down menu. Since you're creating a test TikTok Shop App, select the service category that most closely aligns with your business. If you're unsure which service category to choose, select **Catalog**->**Product Listing** as you'll soon be creating a test Seller account and this will allow you to view your test products.
Next, enter a **default name** for your TikTok Shop App.
Finally, click the **Create** button.
## Step 4: Select target market
Select the **market** and the TikTok Shop **seller type**. At this point, you can simply select your local region for **market** and select **local sellers** for **seller type**.
## Step 5: Enable API and redirect URL
Click on the control to **enable API**.
Next, enter your **redirect URL**. The redirect URL is the URL that the TikTok Shop authorization server calls back when a TikTok Seller or Creator consents to share their data with your TikTok Shop App. This callback includes the **authorization code** as a query parameter, and you'll use this to generate an **access code** in the next section.
Since you're just getting started and you'll be using your test Seller account to generate access tokens, you can simply use your browser to retrieve the authorization code. If you're further along in your getting started journey and you have an HTTP service running on **localhost** on your local machine, you can use that instead.
If you don't have an HTTP service for your redirect URL at this point, it's recommended that you simply use the browser. In this case, it's best to enter `http://localhost` since it's not a real website and your browser won't be redirected to a real website.
## Step 6: Create your TikTok Shop App
Click **create** to create your TikTok Shop App. When you're redirected to the confirmation page, you'll see two critical pieces of information:

* **App Key**
   * The unique identification of the service.
* **App Secret**
   * The application key generated by the platform when you create an app. You can use this secret to obtain the API access token.

You'll need both of these to generate an access token, but you don't need to write these down; you can look this information up in the TikTok Developer Center Console.
# Next Steps
Now that you've created a TikTok Shop App, you can [Create a test seller account](create-test-seller-account) and use the test Seller account to consent to sharing data with your newly created TikTok Shop App.
