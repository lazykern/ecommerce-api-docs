In order to use Quality Engine Incident Statistics in Partner Center Developer Dashboard, and for maintaining the required Partner close rate for Incidents, it is recommended for all developers to integrate their TikTok Shop Developer Apps with Quality Engine APIs available here: [API Documentation - Quality Engine Order Data Exchange API](https://bytedance.sg.larkoffice.com/docx/A6qMdwPC5oESvkxLuffcAVMbnLc)
There are two different types of Incidents for TikTok Shop Orders that developers and partners are alerted to, and must address and close using the Incident Feedback and Close Process in document below.
### A- LOC Incident Statistics

TikTok Shop Orders that are cancelled by the system for missing order `shipping_due_time` SLA, and are cancelled by the reason `system_cancel_order_reason_shipping_timeout` are counted in the system as A-LOC. It is important to prevent A-LOC orders as much as possible to avoid loss of order revenue for both sellers and TikTok Shop. TikTok Shop Partners are recommended to keep **A-LOC rate < 0.01%.**
A-LOC rate for a specific period is defined as:
