In the TikTok Shop API Reference, each endpoint is grouped under one **entity tag**. These tags enable developers to quickly understand:

* The type of entity the API operates on (e.g., seller, shop, partner, creator, asset) and its access boundaries
* The type of authorization required (e.g., shop token, seller token)

This organization provides developers with clear context about each endpoint's scope, and use it correctly within their integration.

Example of an API entity tag
# Types of entity tag
## Seller tag
Endpoints with the `Seller` tag operate at the **seller account level**. A [seller access token](authorization-overview-202407#Get%20Access%20Token%20API) is required to access the seller's data.
These endpoints are mainly used to manage seller-level data that support cross-shop operations. This includes seller-wide metadata (e.g. retrieving shops owned by the seller), reusable assets (e.g. uploading shop-agnostic images), and global product data used to replicate local product listings across multiple shops (e.g. creating global product).
They cannot be used to access or manage individual local shop data such as local products or a shop's orders.
## Shop tag
Endpoints with the `Shop` tag operate at the **local shop level**. A [seller access token](authorization-overview-202407#Get%20Access%20Token%20API) and a [shop cipher](get-authorized-shops) is required to access the shop data. Each shop has its own shop cipher, and the data is isolated from other shops.
These endpoints are mainly used to manage data within a shop, such as listing a product in a shop, retrieving its orders, and so on.
They cannot be used to access or manage data that spans across multiple shops under the same seller account.
## Account tag
Endpoints with the `Account` tag operate at the **partner account level.** A [partner access token](authorization-overview-202407#Get%20Access%20Token%20API) is required to access the partner's data.
These endpoints are mainly used for managing data related to the partner account, such as retrieving the list of business category assets that a partner has authorized for an app.
They cannot be used to access or manage a partner's campaign assets directly.
## Creator tag
Endpoints with the `Creator` tag operate at the **creator account level.** A [creator access token](authorization-overview-202407#Get%20Access%20Token%20API) is required to access the creator's data.
These endpoints are mainly used to manage data related to a creator, such as obtaining a creator's profile, retrieving affiliate orders generated by the creator, searching for open collaboration items, and so on.
## Asset tag
Endpoints with the `Asset` tag operate at the **partner's campaign asset level**. A [partner access token](authorization-overview-202407#Get%20Access%20Token%20API) and the relevant [category asset cipher](get-authorized-category-assets) is required to access a partner's campaign data.
These endpoints are mainly used to manage affiliate marketing campaigns and handle campaign products.
