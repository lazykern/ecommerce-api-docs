Before you can launch your app, you must test it thoroughly with TikTok Shop's Seller Center functionality. We offer the following developer tools that you can use to test your app's functionality with Seller Center.

* Development Shop
* API Testing Tool

The Development Shop allows you to build and test your apps by simulating various seller workflows without impacting real shop data, while the API Testing Tool allows you to access API request and response parameters.
# Development Shop
With Development Shop, developers can gain access to all production environment features, including returns, refunds, promotions, and customer support functionality.
