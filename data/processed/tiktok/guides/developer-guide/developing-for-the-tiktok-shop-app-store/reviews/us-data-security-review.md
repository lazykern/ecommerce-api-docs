The US Data Security Questionnaire is provided and managed by our US Data Security team. The specific purpose of the form is to gather information about a developer to ensure they are keeping US user data safe and secure, in line with TikTok Shop expectations and best practices. All developers building apps for the US market must go through this process during app development.
This review is conducted with the best interest in mind of not only our users, but also our sellers, advertisers, partners and company. Furthermore, an app cannot launch in the TikTok Shop US App Store without approval from the US Data Security team. This team will make their determination based on the inputs to this form (this review process typically can take 10-12 business days after submission).
There are a number of causes why a developer can get rejected during this process. In certain instances we may have follow up questions or ask for additional information, and in other instances we may completely reject a developer for security reasons. The TikTok Shop App Store team will follow up if necessary. Should the additional information not suffice or address the concerns of the US Data Security team, the developer will not be able to launch an app.
Please ensure that you are answering all questions thoroughly and truthfully to make this process as streamlined as possible.
