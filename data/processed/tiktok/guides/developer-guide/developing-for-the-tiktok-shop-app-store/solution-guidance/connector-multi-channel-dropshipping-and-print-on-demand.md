# App Categories
This application requirement document (ARD) lists features for the follow application types:
## Connector
A connector app connects two platforms (TikTok Shop and another e-commerce platform) and shares data between the two platforms to enable sellers to manage their TikTok Shop more efficiently. Popular e-commerce platforms include: Shopify, Salesforce Commerce Cloud, WooCommerce, and BigCommerce.
## Multi-Channel
A multi-channel app (MCA) supports sellers in more efficiently managing products and shipping orders. You can think of MCAs as connector apps that allow TikTok Shop to share data with multiple different e-commerce platforms, instead of one-to-one.
## Dropshipping
A dropshipping app is a software program or application that allows businesses to source products from third-party suppliers and sell them directly to customers without holding inventory. The app typically automates the ordering process and allows for seamless coordination between the supplier and retailer.
## Print on Demand
A print on demand app is a platform that allows users to create and sell custom products without having to purchase inventory or handle shipping. These products typically include t-shirts, phone cases, mugs, and more. The app connects the seller to a printing partner who prints the product on demand when an order is placed. This allows sellers to easily launch a product line and test the market without the risk of investing in upfront inventory.
