### Definition and basic business introductions

* **TikTok Shop**: TikTok Shop is an innovative new shopping feature that enables sellers, brands, and creators to showcase and sell products directly on TikTok through in-feed videos, LIVEs, the product showcase tab, and the Shop Tab (2nd tab of the TikTok app) in some of the markets.
* [TikTok Shop Partner Center (TTSPC)](https://partner.tiktokshop.com/): Build software integrations and applications using TikTok Shop APIs to help you to manage, automate, and grow your businesses on TikTok Shop. As a seller, you can also directly integrate your TikTok Shop with your app to manage your business.
* **TikTok Shop seller developers:** Choose this type if you are a TikTok Shop seller who intends to only develop custom apps and services that integrate directly with TikTok Shop to support your own operations.

### Business flow of TikTok Shop

You should have a TikTok Shop seller account first.
