# Background
TikTok Shop has launched a new category ("Creator Collaboration" ) of APIs focused on affiliate marketing for beta testing on TikTok Shop. These APIs will provide Sellers, Creator Affiliates, and TikTok Shop Partners with more efficient ways to create, manage, matchmake, track, monetize, and collaborate across TikTok Shop Affiliate Collaborations and Partner Campaigns.
This document is written to provide clear onboarding & termination rules for this category during the onboarding process.
# **Scope**
This rule applies to affiliate developers registered in the United States who wish to become "Creator Collaboration" developers on TikTok Shop and provide software to merchants and creators.
The onboarding/termination rules will be updated regularly as the business develops. Please check these rules regularly to ensure that you always follow our current rules.

2. **Platform announces review results:** The platform will review the application submitted by developers within 7 working days after the submission. 
3. **Partner applies for the affiliate APIs**: once the partner gets approved for the category Creator Collaboration, or gets approved to apply for the affiliate APIs, the partner can apply for the APIs via the TikTok Shop Partner Center.
4. **Partner starts integration development**: Once the partner gets access to the relevant APIs, integration development can start


**Review mechanism:**
The application for Affiliate API submitted by developers will be jointly reviewed by members of the product operations, product manager, and technical teams related to the TikTok Shop Alliance API project.
