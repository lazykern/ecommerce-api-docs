# 📌 Checklist
Once you're ready to launch your public app, you must go through review requirements before you can make your app live:

1. Pass the registration review
2. Complete and submit your language listing form for review.
3. Initiate and complete your app review.
4. Prior to launch, all public apps require a compliance review. You can find this step within the app checklist or under **My Account**. If you can't find the compliance review step, double-check to ensure your app is listed as public. If you require further troubleshooting, please reach out to our support team.
5. App reviews and beta testing are required for apps that fall under the "Connector" category.

<div style="text-align: center"><img src="https://p16-arcosite-va.ibyteimg.com/tos-maliva-i-10qhjjqwgv-us/01dfb0c98f4d43a192fcf75643d8fc6a~tplv-10qhjjqwgv-image.image" width="1952px" /></div>

## Notes:

* If you have already finished a language listing form for another market, you can use the **translate and import from** feature to auto-fill the listing form. Refer to the Translate and import your listing section below for more information.
* You can click **Save** at the top of the form to save your progress.

Complete the following steps for each market in which you wish to list your app:

1. In the **Service overview** section, provide an overview of your app, including:
   * The name of your app. A concise name helps to attract more sellers. It's the first thing sellers will see when browsing the App & Service Store.
   * The logo for your app. If your logo contains any text, please ensure that the text is in the same language as the app.
   * A short introductory description of your app.
   * Media (images or video) that highlights your app's functionality and benefits. You should choose at least one image or one video to describe your service. We highly recommend providing a video rather than an image.
2. In the **Detail introduction** section, provide the functional details of your app, including:
   * Three key benefits of your app. We recommend that you use this space to address the requirements of sellers, focusing on their needs, rather than how a particular feature works.
   * Additional images of your app to attract sellers. We recommend providing at least three images that introduce your app's featured functions, images of staff, or success stories.
   * A detailed and comprehensive description of your app's key features and what sellers can do with your app.
   * A list of platforms/services with which your app can integrate. This information allows sellers to quickly determine whether your app is compatible with the platform(s) they are using.
3. In the **Contact & support** section, provide contact information and help resources to support sellers using your app, including:
   * A valid email address and, optionally, a phone number.
   * Optionally, links to your official website and app FAQs, user guide, etc.
4. Click **Next listing** to submit your app listing for review and move to the next listing (if applicable).

**Note:** Once you submit the form, you can't edit it during the review process. You are able to edit the language listing form and resubmit if we reject your listing.

## Translate and import your listing content
Once you've finished creating your app listing for a specific market, you have the option to utilize the **Translate and Import from** feature, which allows you to efficiently translate your listings for various markets. However, it's important to keep in mind that the content generated by this feature is based on machine translation and may contain errors or omissions. As the content's accuracy ultimately rests with you, we strongly recommend thoroughly reviewing and verifying the automatically populated information.

# Ensure you pass the compliance and legal review
You must pass the compliance and legal review for the respective market before you can successfully list your app on the TikTok Shop (TTS) App and Service Store. Communicate with the Partner Development & Management team for your market to verify the status of your review.
You should have initiated the [compliance and review process](data-security-and-privacy-review) during [onboarding](developer-onboarding) depending on your market. Contact the Partner Development & Management team for your market if you have not initiated the process yet or you are not sure whether you require this review.

* US: [partner.us@tiktokshop.com](mailto:partner.us@tiktokshop.com)
* UK: [partner.uk@tiktokshop.com](mailto:partner.uk@tiktokshop.com)
* Other: [partner@tiktokshop.com](mailto:partner@tiktokshop.com)

# Publish and list your app
After you complete and submit the app review and language listing forms, and ensure you've passed the compliance review, you have finished all the steps necessary to publish and list your public app.
You can check the publishing status of your app on the app and service detail page.

* If TTS approves your app, we will automatically make it available on the App and Service Store for sellers to authorize. In addition, we will provide you with an "Authorize link" you can copy and share with sellers individually.
* If TTS rejects your app, click **Edit** to view our reasoning, make adjustments, and resubmit your app for further review.

# Add new markets for your online public App
For online public App, if you have added new markets to your account, you may choose to list your existing public App to the new markets by clicking " **Add market" on the detail page.**
<div style="text-align: center"><img src="https://p16-arcosite-va.ibyteimg.com/tos-maliva-i-10qhjjqwgv-us/189efc83642c40cb89e608c028e0edfc~tplv-10qhjjqwgv-image.image" width="2836px" /></div>

When adding the markets, you will be required to fill in the corresponding language listings for the added markets and submit them for separate market reviews. After the market review passes, the public App will be listed to the relevant target sellers on the **TikTok Shop Seller Center App Store**.
