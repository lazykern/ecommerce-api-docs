There are no additional steps required to publish your app once you submit the basic information for your custom app in Partner Center and establish your workspace.
Click **Publish** to make your app live and generate the "Authorize link", which you can copy and share with sellers individually. The Authorize link is how a seller authorizes and integrates their shop with your app.
Custom apps are not publicly available on the TikTok Shop (TTS) App and Service Store, so we do not require you to provide any additional listing information. In addition, most custom apps (depending on the category) do not require any reviews.

**Note:** App reviews are **required** for apps that fall under the "Connector" category, or have reached 25 or more seller authorizations. These custom apps will see a notification in Partner Center to either upgrade to public and complete testing, or complete app review to remain custom.
# 📌 Checklist
Once you're ready to launch your custom app, you must go through review requirements before you can make your app live:

1. Pass the registration review.
2. If required by your case, ensure you've passed the compliance and legal review you initiated during onboarding.
   **Note:** Contact the Partner Development & Management team for your market if you have not already initiated the compliance and legal review process.
3. App reviews and beta testing if necessary.

# Convert your custom app to a public app
If you determine that your published custom app can offer value to sellers outside your app's original seller scope, Partner Center offers the ability to convert your custom app to a public app. This allows you to make your app available on the TikTok Shop App and Service Store.
For a published custom app, you can click **Upgrade to Public Service** to convert your app from custom to public. Please note this is a beta feature on a gray test, and you may not see the button if you are not on the test invite list.
**Important:**

* You can't upgrade a custom app to public if you have not published the app yet.
* You can't change the target sellers fields (i.e. the market and seller type) when converting the app type from custom to public.
* You'll need to fill in all language listings before you can submit the custom app for upgrade review.
* The app type will remain custom until the app passes the upgrade review and reviews for all selected markets.
