## Why did we build it?
Pricing is a crucial consideration for sellers when deciding to download an app from the App Store or choosing between different apps. Developers might also wish to highlight their competitive pricing as a unique selling point to differentiate themselves from competitors. Therefore, we need to build the ability to enable developers to set up and display pricing to sellers.
## What do we build?
Allow developers to enter pricing details for **public apps** which will then be shown to sellers in the App Store.
### Partner Side(For ISV)
When ISVs create public apps in TTSPC, they have a new section to input price info in the service listing review.

Partners can select from three pricing options:

1. **"Free Plan":** Opt for this if your app is free to all sellers.
2. **"Paid Plan":** Choose this if your app charges under certain conditions.

a. You can offer a "free trial" and specify the trial duration, such as 30 days.
b. You may set your minimum price(mandatory) and a maximum price (optional)

3. **"Contact for Price":** This is suitable if your pricing is variable.
4. You can also provide a link to your official website's pricing page for sellers to reference.

For existing apps that you already published, you can also click edit to add price information. Your edit will be reviewed again before online.

### Seller Side(For Seller)
Sellers can browse apps in the APP Store-Seller Center and check price tags on the app card.
Please note: price information is provided by partners. There would not be a price if the partner didn't input their price information

By clicking the app card, the seller can go to the app's detailed page and check for more price information about this app.
