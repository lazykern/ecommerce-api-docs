# Introduction: What is the TSP Company Profile?
To improve matchmaking efficiency between sellers and TSPs and help merchants to form a comprehensive understanding of TSPs, the TSP profile feature includes the following key functions:

1. Allows TSPs to manage their company profile information on the TikTok Shop Partner Center.
2. Upgrades the TSP Portal (Seller Center and independent website) from a service-level layout to a company-level layout, accommodating scenarios such as sorting, badging, ranking, etc.

# What are the benefits？
TSPs can enhance their visibility to potential clients by effectively managing their profiles and showcasing their unique strengths.
