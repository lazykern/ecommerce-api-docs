TSP should fill in the related reason for cancellation and leave a note if needed. Which would make it easier for the seller to check and review.
# Step 2: Seller checks and replies to requests.
After a TSP initiates a cancellation, the seller can view the request on the My Service page:

1. If the seller chooses "Agree," the authorization will be canceled immediately.
2. If the seller chooses "Reject," the authorization will remain valid. You may contact the seller or resubmit your request after 144 hours.
3. **If the seller does not respond within 72 hours, the authorization will be automatically canceled.**
