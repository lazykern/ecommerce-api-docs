Dear Partner,
We encourage you to expand and activate all three partner service categories in Partner Center: **Creator Matchmaking, Seller Service,** and **Creator Service.** Doing so allows you to unlock more collaboration opportunities and can help you grow your business more effectively.

By offering more comprehensive services, you not only provide end-to-end support to sellers and creators but also improve the chances of reaching a higher TSP Tier. 
Partners offering a single service have their final score calculated with a 90% service weight, while those offering multiple services benefit from an average score across services, multiplied by a higher weight of 110% to 130%. This increased weight gives multi-service partners a stronger advantage in tier evaluation, unlocking higher ranking, operational protection, marketing support, and more collaboration opportunities. 
*For more details on tier calculation and benefits, please refer to the information provided here: https://partner.tiktokshop.com/docv2/page/68411b45314d2504a1a7c407

To activate new service categories:
Go to Partner Center > My Account > Service Category and register the services you'd like to provide.
