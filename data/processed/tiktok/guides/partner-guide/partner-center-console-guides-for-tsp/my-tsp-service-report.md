# FAQ
## Q1: If I don't upload the TSP Service Report, will it impact my current authorization with the seller?
No, uploading the TSP service report is not necessary until you have received authorization from the seller. It won't affect your existing authorization. However, it is required for calculating your incentives and assessing your performance with TikTok Shop. ++For more details on the policy, please reach out to your TSP Manager.++
Please be aware that you're not limited to providing just a report or contract as proof of service; you can also submit other substantial materials that verify your service.
## Q2: what would happen to the Service Report if the seller cancels the authorization or TikTok shop account is unbonded？
It will not affect the report/contract information which has already been uploaded.
