## **🔥 Optimization Overview**
## Why do we build this feature?
For ISV and TSP, they are not able to change product information once the service has been published online. This brings inconvenience for TSP&ISV to build authorization with a new Seller.
## ⭐️ **Key updates**
### Support ISV & Cross border TSP to add new Seller Market
If you want to add a new target seller to your public/custom service, you can go to service detail page and click edit seller type
<div style="text-align: center"><img src="https://p16-arcosite-va.ibyteimg.com/tos-maliva-i-10qhjjqwgv-us/cdf7e940a5864e39b109e3597af2d3f9~tplv-10qhjjqwgv-image.image" width="1280px" /></div>

You can add a new seller type or delete the existing seller type.
Please note:

* If you are adding a new seller type and click save, you need to provide a service listing based on the target seller language
* If you are adding a new seller type without the category certification in this market, you can go to my account page to apply for category certification first
* If you delete the seller type and click save, the corresponding listing will also be deleted
