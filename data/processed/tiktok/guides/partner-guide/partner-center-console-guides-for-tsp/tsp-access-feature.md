## **Background**
TikTok Shop Partners (TSPs) are e-commerce service providers focused on Seller Service (Shop Management, LIVE Management, Short Video Management, Seller Affiliate Management). They often need to log into the seller center to assist merchants with their daily activities. However, there are a couple of significant challenges. For example, TSPs face the inconvenience of juggling multiple sub-accounts when performing operations on behalf of sellers. 
To streamline the way TSPs request and log into Seller Center, we are offering the TSP access feature for TSPs to log into Seller Center and start operation with one click. Plus, TSPs can also initiate and manage conversations with creators through Creator IM under TSP Access, facilitating affiliate collaboration on the seller’s behalf.
