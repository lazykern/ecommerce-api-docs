# Steps
### Step 1: Create a service proposal
To build an official service relationship with the seller, TSP can navigate to the [Seller Management-Create Service proposal](https://partner.us.tiktokshop.com/order/serviceMerchantManager?region=US) page to check authorization and create a new service proposal.
Note: To ensure you can create a service proposal successfully, please ensure you have at least one approved service (Status: On) under the related category. TSP can go to the[ APP & Service](https://partner.us.tiktokshop.com/service/list/?tab=4) page to double-check.

TSP can provide signing information for seller checking and signing off, which includes:

1. **Seller Information:** TSP can select a seller by either **shop name** or **shop code.**

2. **Select Service Details:** TSP has the option to select either a single service or multiple service categories, which include Live Management, Affiliate Management, Shop Operation and Management, and Short Video Management. For each service proposal, TSP needs to provide the related information as specified below.

### Step 2: Seller views and signs the proposal
After creating a service proposal, TSP can share the proposal link with the seller to sign.
<div style="text-align: center"><img src="https://p16-arcosite-va.ibyteimg.com/tos-maliva-i-10qhjjqwgv-us/517b49f0328646bca2553e0585b93f95~tplv-10qhjjqwgv-image.image" width="200px" /></div>

When the seller opens the proposal link, they can view the service proposal, which includes basic information about the TSP and detailed service offerings across various categories. After reviewing, the seller has the option to either reject or accept the proposal. If accepted, the seller and TSP will officially be signed up for the specific service.
**Please note:** Sellers are not able to modify the proposal. If there are any questions or concerns about the service proposal, sellers can contact TSP.

### Step 3: Check and manage the sign details
After signing, the seller can go to my services page to view all signing details. By clicking View the Details, the seller can check the detailed signing information

TSP can navigate to the [seller management-service proposals](https://partner.us.tiktokshop.com/order/serviceMerchantManager?region=US) page to check all signing information

***How to renew the signing with the Seller？**
TSPs have the option to select the 'Extend' button to create a renewal application. They can then edit the new service period. After making these adjustments, TSPs can share the signing link with the seller for review and approval.

***How to cancel the existing signing with the seller？**
TSP can navigate to TikTok Shop Partner Center-> Seller Management and click delete to raise a cancel signing request.

After a TSP initiates a cancellation, the seller can view the request on the My Service page:

1. If the seller chooses "Agree," the authorization will be canceled immediately.
2. If the seller chooses "Reject," the authorization will remain valid. You may contact the seller or resubmit your request after 144 hours.
3. **If the seller does not respond within 72 hours, the authorization will be automatically canceled.**

# Notes

1. To ensure you can create a service proposal successfully, please make sure you have at least **one live (Status "on") service** under the related category. TSP can go to the **My service** page to double-check.
2. During the same period, **one** seller shop/account can only be signed with **one** TSP under the same service category. If the seller already has an existing agreement with another TSP under the same category, an error code may occur. In this case, the seller must choose only one TSP to sign with.
3. This new singing process will not affect existing authorization between TSP and the seller, but we recommend TSP to upload service details for existing authorization, especially the Live Management service.

# FAQs
### Why does my service proposal show an error？
During the same period, a seller shop/account can only be signed with one TSP under the same service category. Please guide your seller to check on **My service** page to see if there is already an existing signed service proposal.
