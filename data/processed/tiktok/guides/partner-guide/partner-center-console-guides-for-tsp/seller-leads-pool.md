**Key Features & Benefits:**

* Quality Leads: Service Partners can review seller business profiles and requirements before deciding to connect
* Full Control: Service Partners can choose which inquiries to pursue and access seller contact details once they accept a lead
* Easy Updates: Service Partners can track lead status from initial inquiry through to final partnership

# How it Works
## Two types of seller leads
|  | Open leads | Target leads |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Seller | When a seller doesn't have a particular TSP in mind for their inquiry, they can opt for "open leads." This choice allows the platform to analyze the seller's needs and recommend suitable TSPs based on the services required. | When a seller already knows which TSP or TSPs they are interested in working with, they can select "target leads." This option enables sellers to direct their inquiries specifically to one or more chosen TSPs. |
| TSP | Only the TSP assigned by the platform can check the leads <br> * Please note: All successfully onboard TSP can be assigned to Seller | Only the TSP chosen by the Seller can check leads <br> Please note: only TSPs who publish public services can be chosen by the Seller |
| Platform | Can assign TSP for seller | --- |
### Step 1 Seller can initiate a request on the TSP portal
Sellers can find the request entrance on **Seller Center- TikTok Shop Partner-Request a Partner**, or go to the service details page to click Contact Partners.

<div style="text-align: center"><img src="https://p16-arcosite-va.ibyteimg.com/tos-maliva-i-10qhjjqwgv-us/fe6a38957df8423caba4ecfc777d7cc5~tplv-10qhjjqwgv-image.image" width="1854px" /></div>

The seller can click close to close the inquiry, either on inquiry level or partner level.
After closing, your inquiry will not be able to be shared with new partner, and existing partner who has claimed the leads will no longer check your contact information.
<div style="text-align: center"><img src="https://p16-arcosite-va.ibyteimg.com/tos-maliva-i-10qhjjqwgv-us/afdf1c28dffd436bbea4d4c08df7ea10~tplv-10qhjjqwgv-image.image" width="1048px" /></div>

TikTok Shop Partner Center
### Step 5 TSP Review leads and follow up
Partners can click view details to check the detailed information of the seller.
![Image](https://p16-arcosite-va.ibyteimg.com/tos-maliva-i-10qhjjqwgv-us/ba52097f6ea1441eb3ec64e54eeb55f0~tplv-10qhjjqwgv-image.image)

If a partner chooses to follow up, seller leads will be transferred to the "following" tab, and the partner can click"view details" to check the **contact information** of the seller.
<div style="text-align: center"><img src="https://p16-arcosite-va.ibyteimg.com/tos-maliva-i-10qhjjqwgv-us/0f2d77003b88447bbc111cf1cd27bb8c~tplv-10qhjjqwgv-image.image" width="1914px" /></div>

If the partner decides to reject the request, they will no longer have access to view the seller's information. Partners have the option to select a reason for rejection, which will not be visible to the seller.
<div style="text-align: center"><img src="https://p16-arcosite-va.ibyteimg.com/tos-maliva-i-10qhjjqwgv-us/6bf402c085d940a8a4e50cb2ab61f49f~tplv-10qhjjqwgv-image.image" width="590px" /></div>

### Step 3 TSP Accept or reject cooperation
After a discussion with the seller, the partner can go to the following tab to accept the cooperation results.
<div style="text-align: center"><img src="https://p16-arcosite-va.ibyteimg.com/tos-maliva-i-10qhjjqwgv-us/a791c24a959f4abc9cdea87f08b4744b~tplv-10qhjjqwgv-image.image" width="1914px" /></div>

If a seller grants authorization to a TSP following the lead submission, their collaboration will automatically move to the "Reach a Deal" section. Here, the TSP can view the authorization details under "Reach a Deal - View Details."
Additionally, if automatic matching doesn't work (eg, seller authorized before initiating inquiry) , partners can manually enter the authorization ID by selecting "Accept Cooperation."
