# TSP Shop Analytics
## Summary
For TSPs that provide Shop Management services, it is important that they can monitor their sellers' shop performances in order to compare top performing shops, review product performances, identify shops that need attention, and more. The **Shop Analytics** page is a one-stop hub that gives TSPs the convenience of accessing all those insights and more via 3 performance modules:

1. Overview
2. Your Sellers
3. Shop Tab

By using Shop Analytics, TSPs no longer need to login to various sellers' accounts via Seller Center to analyze various shop performances separately. Read on to learn how to utilise Shop Analytics, or **visit Shop Analytics by navigating to:** [Partner Center > Analytics > Shop](https://partner.tiktokshop.com/compass/shop-analysis)

The Overview tab provides you with comprehensive insights into all your managed shops' performances and is broken down into 4 sections:
