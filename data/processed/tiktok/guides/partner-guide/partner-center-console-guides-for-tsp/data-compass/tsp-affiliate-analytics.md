We have introduced a new section within the **Analytics section** of the Partner Centre called **Affiliate Analytics**. This is available for all TSPs who have signed up under the following categories (these are also known as **Affiliate Management services**) and these TSPs can bind with their sellers at a shop level:
| **Category** | **Sub-category** |
| --- | --- |
| **Shop Management** | Shop Management |
| **Shop Management** | Shop Registration |
| **Shop Management** | Integrated Marketing |
| **Shop Management** | Logistics Management |
| **Operation Tutoring** | Operation Tutoring |
Previously, TSPs were unable to provide adequate support and guidance for sellers to grow their business through their affiliate marketing channel due to this data not being visible to them. Therefore, this new section will allow TSPs to access detailed affiliate performance insights to support sellers' growth and help them identify which creators they should work with.
**How can TSPs work with sellers to provide Affiliate Management services?**

1. Seller and TSP bind at shop level to provide Affiliate Management service.
2. TSP reviews seller's product, product category, brand and target customer segment and then starts searching for creators that will help seller to promote their products.
3. TSP contacts creators to gauge their interest in promoting sellers' products. Based on the creator's interest, TSPs connect the seller and creator to discuss the opportunity.
4. The seller or TSP sends a product sample to the selected creator and tracks product views, GMV and other metrics from the sample.
5. Based on the performance of the sample, TSP and Seller align on whether they want to further invest with the creator.
6. After alignment with the seller to continue to work with the creator, TSP discusses the channel for promotion - LIVE, Video, and Showcase and negotiates the commission.
7. After the alignment in the above step, creators can create content (Live or Video) and promote the products via their Showcase.
8. The TSP can monitor the GMV from the creators that the seller is working with and confirm if the creator is the right fit for the sellers' products.
