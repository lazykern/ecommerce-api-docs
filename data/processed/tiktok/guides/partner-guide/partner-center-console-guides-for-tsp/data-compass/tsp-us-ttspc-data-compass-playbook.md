<div style="text-align: center"><img src="https://p16-arcosite-va.ibyteimg.com/tos-maliva-i-10qhjjqwgv-us/52f34fbd28154979b3109fd50edefb2a~tplv-10qhjjqwgv-image.image" width="1440px" /></div>

If you're a **new TSP or have not sent an authorization request** to the seller to view their data, you can follow the steps below.
## **Get authorization for Seller Center from Sellers**
Sellers can authorize TSPs to access the Seller Center in one of 2 ways:

1. Through the Seller Center
2. Through an authorization request sent by TSP

Please note：

2. TSP access can only be added to services that are currently valid
3. Only the main account of the seller has the authority to authorize TSP services

### **Available authorization Actions in** **Seller Center**

1. **New TSP-Seller Binding Relationships**

When a seller connects to a new TSP, they have the option to choose the **[Authorized Seller Center permission role]** option. Here the seller can assign which sections of their Seller Center they want to provide access to a TSP and press submit.

background：
When a partner binds a shop to provide **shop level management services**, it's crucial for them to have an overview of the shop level data and conduct further analytics to optimize their operation strategies.++ From June 2024, TSPs are allowed to access up to ++**++six months ++**++of historical data from current date or bind date++
## Introductions
When TSPs bind at Shop level, they will have access to Shop Analytics that will have data for all accounts(Seller/Creator) associated with the Shop.

be precise, Shop Analytics data should be accessible only when TSPs and Seller bind at a Shop level.
We have updated the Shop Analytics tab to provide you with a new GMV section. This will show the overall GMV for all sellers who have authorised you to view their data.
Besides, you will be able to view the key metrics of each shop you manage, shown in the image below. The Direct GMV figures listed here mirror the ones displayed on the Seller Center.

![Image](https://p16-arcosite-va.ibyteimg.com/tos-maliva-i-10qhjjqwgv-us/b6770bcdd61d45cfb856a23e9cc73d02~tplv-10qhjjqwgv-image.image)
# **Livestream analytics**
## Background：
There is insufficient trust between the seller and the organization. For example, in the Indonesian market, 95% of sellers are unwilling to provide their accounts directly to the organization. As a result, the partner does not have enough data to assist the sellers in optimizing the live.
90% of the sellers and partners have remote contact. The TSP hopes to view the data through the portal to achieve real-time guidance to the sellers.
## Problem We Solve：
Without obtaining the seller's account and log in to the streamer desktop to obtain the seller's LIVE data to help the seller to optimize the operation strategy
When the partner‘s seller starts LIVE, partner can achieve the real-time guide for seller
## Key Function：

* Partner portal live screen: support to view live & real-time data of multiple sellers at the same time
* Review the live data: support viewing the historical live data of its sellers
* Authorization of the seller data：Only after the partner obtains the permission of the seller data, it can check the data of its seller's

## Detail of product：

1. **Ongoing livestreams**

There are sellers on live：
<div style="text-align: center"><img src="https://p16-arcosite-va.ibyteimg.com/tos-maliva-i-10qhjjqwgv-us/b9a5ccb792864c7d92280a3d1882891b~tplv-10qhjjqwgv-image.image" width="958px" /></div>

Here, you can see the avatars, names and handles of people who are currently on LIVE (you can filter specific seller by name or handle). After clicking the upper left corner, the corresponding live room card of the person will appear below. **For those who have obtained data authorization**, the number of online people, the number of transactions, the number of payment orders, and the number of product clicks will be displayed on the card.
<div style="text-align: center"><img src="https://p16-arcosite-va.ibyteimg.com/tos-maliva-i-10qhjjqwgv-us/8d57237c4cf849fe85535f31d9d70711~tplv-10qhjjqwgv-image.image" width="518px" /></div>

When we click on any live card, more detailed information will be displayed, the number of online people, the number of transactions, the number of created orders, the number of payment orders, the number of product exposures, the number of product clicks, GMV, and comments.
<div style="text-align: center"><img src="https://p16-arcosite-va.ibyteimg.com/tos-maliva-i-10qhjjqwgv-us/4f4641d535144b17bdeb16af2271f08e~tplv-10qhjjqwgv-image.image" width="954px" /></div>
