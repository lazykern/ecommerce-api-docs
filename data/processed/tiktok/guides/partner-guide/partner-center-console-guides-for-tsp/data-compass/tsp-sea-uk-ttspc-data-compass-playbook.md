# ❗️Important Notice for New TTSPC Users：
## Data Authorization ：
For agencies, please note that in order for you to view this data, the seller has to authorize this service. This means that the seller must authorize their shop or TikTok account **(only official or marketing accounts)** with you.
However, if the seller chooses to authorize the [Shop Management] service only, you will not be able to view the data of the whole shop or official or marketing accounts. Only when sellers select the [content management], can the TSP view data of official or marketing accounts.
After using the New TTSPC, we regard the bound time as data authorization time, if the seller hasn't authorized data to the TSP but is already bound with TSP, or the authorization date is later than the bound date, the data time range the TSP can view begins from the bound date.
No other data authorization process is needed.

# Data Function Introduction:
**++Shop vs Account level data++**
For all Partners that are **++not++** under the Shop Management category, you will notice differences in GMV data between Partner Centre and Seller Centre. This is because, as a TikTok Shop Partner (TSP), when you bind to a seller, the GMV data displayed to you in the Partner Centre is only at **++Account++** level. However, the GMV data displayed on Seller Center is at **++Shop++** level.
**++What are the differences in calculation between Account level and Shop level data?++**
A seller can have up to 5 accounts: 1 Official Account + 4 Marketing Account
Therefore Shop level data includes GMV from **++all the accounts++** associated with the seller, including the Shop Page. However, as a TSP, you might only bind to the sellers Marketing Account, which means in the Partner Centre you only see Marketing Account level data.
++For example (see image below):++ You are a TSP operating under the Content Management service category and are interested in Seller A who has 1 Official Account and 2 Marketing Accounts. However, you only bind to the 2 Marketing Accounts of Seller A.
Therefore, you will see differences in GMV data between Seller A's Seller Centre data (where total GMV will include GMV from the 1 Official Account and 2 Marketing Accounts) and the GMV data you see on Partner Centre (which only includes GMV from 2 Marketing Accounts).
# **Data Overview**
How to use Data Overview?

* To understand the overall transaction performance and sales rate of the seller related accounts, and to see the percentage of sellers with sales, to determine the activity of its sellers and their ability to sell goods.
* Analyze the live/video content channels to analyze the ability of the seller to sell goods, the number of content releases and the CTR conversion rate.

**++Content Type GMV Attribution++**
GMV for sellers will be calculated based on 3 content types, which means now: ****

* **100% GMV (Direct GMV) = Live + Video + Product Card**

This means that for sellers, GMV will be attributed to the last content type that a buyer clicked on when checking out a product. *(Reminder: Product Cards are cards that display everything a customer needs to know about a product, like its title, image, and price).*
All Seller Transaction related metrics such as GMV, C_O, GPM on every module are calculated using this Content Type GMV Attribution.
++For example:++ Buyer A watched a LIVE session promoting an iPhone 15 and adds the iPhone 15 to cart > Buyer A checks out the iPhone 15 from the cart 2 days later > GMV from the iPhone 15 goes to **LIVE**.
*Please note, there will be no changes to how Affiliate GMV is calculated, which means that there will be no changes to how commission paid to Affiliates.*
## Core Data

* **Livestreaming Partners:** The number of partners that have livestreamed during the selected period
* **Active Rate:** (Active Live Partners/ Partners) * 100%

* **LIVE Avg. Direct GMV**: LIVE Direct GMV/ LIVE stream
* **Direct Refund GMV:** The cumulative amount refunded to buyers during the selected period based on Direct GMV achieved. This means that the Refund GMV only calculates GMV from refunded orders based on buyer's last clicked content type and excludes any form of refunded orders from attributed GMV.
* **Video Direct GMV:** Video direct GMV is the total amount paid for orders placed directly from videos, including returns and refunds. This means that GMV is only calculated based on the last clicked video and excludes any form of attributed GMV

## Q&A
