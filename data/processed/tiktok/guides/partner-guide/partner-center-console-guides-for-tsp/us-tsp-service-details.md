# **Summary**
To better measure the actual contribution of TSP to the Seller, the platform is now supporting TSP to upload Service Details. The platform will be able to check your information to verify your service.
**Please note:** You can still work with the seller without service details. However, only authorizations with approved service details will be recognized as valid for GMV performance and will qualify for further platform incentives.
# **Feature introduction**
## Step 1: Click the "Service Details" after getting authorization
After getting authorization from the seller, TSP can visit [Seller management ➤ Service Details](https://partner.us.tiktokshop.com/order/serviceMerchantManager/detail/7416067390716577578/contract?region=US) to create a Service Details for specific authorization.
