# What is the Service Offer？
TSP Service allows TSPs to bundle service lists and offer authorization details for sellers to review and authorize.
TSP will have two options to get authorization from the seller.
**Option 1: Default authorization application**
TSPs can share the “Default authorization application” link with the seller. The seller will need to select authorization details
**Option 2: Prefill service offer [NEW]**
TSPs can offer authorization details by clicking "pre-fill service offer", allowing sellers to either confirm or modify them as necessary.
# Benefits of Service Offer

1. **Enhance authorization efficiency:** TSPs can offer authorization details, allowing sellers to choose without back-and-forth communication.
2. **Authorize multiple services at once:** Instead of authorizing services individually, sellers can now authorize entire TSP service packages through a single service offer.

# **FAQ**
### Q1: Will this service offer replace the existing authorization workflow?
No, the service offered was an additional option for TSP to choose from. If TSP chooses the default authorization application, TSP can still share the authorization link with the seller, The Seller will need to authorize it themselves
