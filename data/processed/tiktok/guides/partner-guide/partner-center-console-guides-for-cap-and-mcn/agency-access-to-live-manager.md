If CAP needs to add a creator live manager tool authorization request for the **linked creator**, CAP can navigate to Creator Management ➤ Manage Partnership ➤ Request LIVE access

> **Note：**

> 1. The request will expire 7 days from when it is sent. Please guide your creator to check after you send the invitation
> 2. CAP would lose access to the creator's LIVE Manager immediately after unlinking
> 3. CAP can't request a LIVE Manager request if there is an existing pending Extend request


## Step 2: Creators check and respond application
After the CAP request, the Creator will be able to receive an application via the **EC center -> System notification -> Cooperation management.** Creators can either accept or decline:

<div style="display: flex;">
<div style="flex-shrink: 0;width: calc((100% - 16px) * 0.5000);">

1. **If Declined:**

 If there's already a linking relationship with the agency, declining will only reject the Live Manager request and will not affect the existing linking relationship.
If the request includes both linking and Live Manager access, declining will result in the deletion of the entire linking relationship.

2. **If accepted:**

Live Manager access is granted for the duration of the CAP linking period.

# Notes

1. Any event created by an agency will be communicated to creators through EC Center notification -> partnership and Creator inbox -> System notification -> Account update
2. CAPs cannot **initiate or end a go-live on the LIVE Manager**. They can only join livestreams that creators have already started, providing support and management during the live session.
3. For Cross-border CAPs, this feature is only available to creators who have a commission-sharing or data-sharing relationship with CAP.


# FAQs
### 1. Can a creator cancel LIVE Manager authorization while still being linked?
Yes, if the Creator only wants to cancel Live Manager authorization without affecting the existing linking relationship, the solution would be that CAP and Creator can unlink first, and then CAP can send linking requests **without requesting LIVE Manager access** (by deselecting the LIVE Manager checkbox when sending the link request).

### 2.Does an agency's activity on LIVE Manager notify creators?
Yes, creators will receive notifications when an agency schedules a new LIVE event or enters the LIVE room as staff.

### 3. Are agency activities that happen behind the scenes displayed as creator activities?
Yes, the LIVE room audience cannot distinguish between agency and creator activities, since agencies perform all actions through LIVE Manager under the creator's account. If you notice any suspicious activities by agencies that may harm your interests, please contact your CAP or customer support for investigation.

### 4.Why can't I request a live manager access？
Please check if there are any pending Link extension requests. LIVE Manager access cannot be requested while a link extension request is pending, and vice versa
