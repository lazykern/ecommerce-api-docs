# Finance
The finance feature allows partners, including **Creator Agency Partner (CAP)** & **TikTok Shop Affiliate Partner (TAP)**, to review and export orders and bills after sharing commissions with Creators.
### Payment Accounts
The **Payment Accounts** section allows partners to set up and update bank accounts to receive payouts.
First, partners need to activate their payment accounts for the relevant market. After activation, you must link your bank account and successfully pass verification to receive payouts. Steps are as follows:
| Step 1 | Go to Finance -> Payment Account and click on 'Activate Account.' | ![Image](https://p16-arcosite-va.ibyteimg.com/tos-maliva-i-10qhjjqwgv-us/364fed6638c146ffae21f97bc6174581~tplv-10qhjjqwgv-image.image) <br>  |

At the top of this page, you can view an overview of your commission data, including:

* **Not Paid**: This represents the amount has not yet been transferred to your bank account. Possible reasons include:
   * Orders are not yet completed.
   * The payout failed due to errors in your bank account details. Please verify your information and click '**Request Payment**' to retry. If it still fails, submit a ticket for assistance.
   * Your earnings have not yet reached the payout threshold, which is $1.00 for US local partners.
   You can go to the '**Pending payment**' and '**Payment failed**' tab to check details.
* **Paid**: this amount reflects the funds that have been successfully transferred to your bank account. You can check details under the '**Paid**' tab.

You can also export the commission order details to an Excel file for easier reconciliation.
#### 2.1 When will I receive the commission?
Starting **April 15, 2025(UTC+0)**, you will receive commissions based on the following rules:

* You will typically receive commission **15 days** after the order delivery date.
* Some orders may take longer due to:
   * Commissions are paid only after the seller's orders are settled. Therefore, if the seller's settlement period is longer, such as Delivery + 31 days, commissions will also be paid to you 31 days after delivery.
   * Commissions can't be paid until the dispute, refund, or return requests are resolved.

#### 2.2 What is the impact of the creator settlement rule change effective April 15, 2025?
Prior to the change, you typically receive commission **within 15 days** (which could be 1, 5, 8, or 15 days) after the order delivery date, up to 31 days after delivery.
Under the new rules, you will typically receive commission **on the 15th day** after the order delivery date, up to 31 days after delivery.
For orders created after April 15, 2025, commission will be paid following the new rules. You may experience a temporary earnings dip for about half of the month post-change, but cash flow will normalize over time.
### Payment Bills
The **Payments** section displays the records of successful payouts, which you can use to reconcile with your bank statements.

If you want to view the commission details for each payment ID, go to the **Paid** tab on the **Earnings** page to export the commission order details. You can use the payment ID column to locate the corresponding orders.
