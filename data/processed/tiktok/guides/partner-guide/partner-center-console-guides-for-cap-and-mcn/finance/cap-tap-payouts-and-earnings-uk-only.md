The finance feature allows partners, including **Creator Agency Partner (CAP)** & **TikTok Shop Affiliate Partner (TAP)**, to review and export orders and bills after sharing commissions with Creators.

**Step 1: Activate Your Payment Account**

1. Navigate to **Finance** > **Payment Account**.
2. Click on the **'Activate Account'** button to begin the process.

At the top of this page, you can view an overview of your commission data, including:

* **Not Paid**: This represents the amount has not yet been transferred to your bank account. Possible reasons include:
   * Orders are not yet completed.
   * The payout failed due to errors in your bank account details. Please verify your information and click '**Request Payment**' to retry. If it still fails, submit a ticket for assistance.
   * Your earnings have not yet reached the payout threshold, which is 1 GBP for UK partners
   You can go to the '**Pending payment**' and '**Payment failed**' tab to check details.
* **Paid**: this amount reflects the funds that have been successfully transferred to your bank account. You can check details under the '**Paid**' tab.

You can also export the commission order details to an Excel file for easier reconciliation.
### When Will I Receive the Commission?
Starting April 1st, 2025 (UTC+0), commissions will be paid based on the following rules:

* You will receive commission **15 days after the order delivery date**.
* Some orders may take longer due to:
   * **Seller settlement periods:** Commissions are paid only after the seller’s orders are settled. If a seller has a longer settlement period (e.g., **Delivery + 31 days**), your commission will also be paid 31 days after delivery.
   * **Refunds or disputes:** Commissions cannot be paid until any product disputes, refund requests, or return requests are resolved.

### What Is the Impact of the Commission Payment Rule Change Effective April 1st, 2025?
Before the change:

* You could receive commission as early as **3 days after delivery** and up to **31 days**, depending on various factors.
* Commissions were **non-refundable**, even if a refund occurred shortly after payment.
* Payment timelines were unpredictable, varying between **3 to 31 days**.

After the change:

* **Fixed timeline:** You will typically receive commission **15 days after delivery** (unless the seller’s settlement period is longer).
* **Refund adjustments:** Commissions are refundable to sellers if a refund occurs before your payment is processed.
* **More predictable cash flow:** A standard 15-day payment period ensures better visibility into commission payouts.
