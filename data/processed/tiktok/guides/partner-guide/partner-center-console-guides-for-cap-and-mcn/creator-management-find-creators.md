## What is Affiliate Marketplace？
The Creator Marketplace helps MCN/CAP discover and partner with TikTok’s Creator community.
## How It Works？

* The Creator Marketplace is a set of features that enable MCN/CAP to connect and collaborate with Creators.
* MCN/CAP can view the contact information of the creator or send an invitation with one click.
* Businesses search for partners by using filters such as *Category, Creator attributes, and Followers*.

## What type of creator can be found on Affiliate Marketplace？
✅ creators who have e-commerce permissions
❌ creators who are not linked with other MCNs
❌ creators who are not official or marketing accounts
## How to use Affiliate Marketplace？
### Step 1 Check and find potential creators
You can go to [creator management] ➤[find creator] ➤[Affiliate Marketplace] and check the creator card on the marketplace
You can use the following filters as you need：

1. **Category:** The first-level category to which the creator belongs
2. **Creator attributes**
   1. **Creator score(only in ID market):** The creator score is calculated based on creator's GMV (sales), livestream count, average livestream viewers and viewing duration, video count, average video views and completed video view rate in the last 30 days
   2. **Creator type:** The creator's better performing content type. Eg. The content type with higher GMV (sales)in the last 30 days
3. **Followers profile:** followers number/ followers age/ followers gender
4. Others
   1. **Quick to respond:** Quick to respond means that creators are quicker to check and respond to messages.
   2. **Posts frequently:** Frequent Posts mean that the creator has published a greater number of short videos or livestreams.
   3. **Reliable with samples:** Reliable with samples means that the creator's fulfillment rate to showcase sellers' samples is well above average.

Note：If there is no creator information under the filter, it may be because creator has not authorized the data.
*If you are a cross-border partner, you can switch markets and check creators under different markets.
