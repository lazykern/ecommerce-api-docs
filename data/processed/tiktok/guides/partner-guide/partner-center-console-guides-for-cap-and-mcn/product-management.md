# What is Product Management？
Product management includes **Product Marketplace** and **Product Sets** which allow you to:

1. **Find and select products:** you can view/search/filter products according to your needs in the product marketplace
2. **Create your product set and share with creator:** you can create a product set and share with your creator using one link

📌 **Note**
Product marketplace will be accessible for all MCN（Category:creator management）and TAP （Category:Seller and Scalable Creator Match-up).
# MCN & TAP Feature Guide
## Step 1 - Pick your products
The Product Marketplace is where you can search and discover products that you would like to
share with your creators. Currently, there are three different ways you can find products:

* **Search:** Use the search bar to look for specific products, categories, or brands that match your interest.
* **Product rankings:** If you're unsure where to start looking for products, the product rankings section is a great place to get inspiration. This section is only available in certain regions.
* **For you:** You can find recommended products based on your preference. The more you use this section, the more customized the results will be.

*If you are cross-boarder MCN & TAP and have multiple markets certification, please choose the market first.
