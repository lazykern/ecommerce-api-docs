* Fill in Creator user name and select a **Link expiration date** (the date cannot be modified, but you can extend the link before it expires).
* Enter the **Fee agreement** **rate** (between 0-100%). This is the management fee percentage that you are taking from the creator's commission for providing CAP Agency services across all content types, including short video, showcase and LIVE.
* Check "**Set an exclusive fee agreement for LIVE only**", enter the commission share percentage (between 0-100%), and enter the proposed commission share rate for the exclusive LIVE fee agreement.
   * Note: the exclusive fee agreement for LIVE is taken as the management fee applied solely to LIVE GMV, and it overrides the standard Fee Agreement rate specified above when calculating the LIVE commission share.

* Check the services terms and click the "**Add**" button to send the Fee Agreement to the Creator.
* The fee agreement will start once the creator accepts the request and the percentage can be changed later by submitting an adjustment request, which requires confirmation from you and the creator.

#### Step II: Creators review and accept a fee agreement

* Creators will receive a notification for the new link request, and they can Agree or Decline the request after reviewing the fee agreement details.

# Commission sharing for Agencies serving as both CAP and TAP
When an Agency serves as both CAP and TAP for its bound creators, the Agency can distribute a TAP product to its CAP-bound Creators for showcases. In this case, product orders will appear in both the CAP and TAP order lists for the Agency, and the Agency will receive (1) TAP commission share set by the Sellers, and (2) CAP commission share agreed upon with the bound Creator.
