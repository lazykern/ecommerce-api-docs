# **Livestream analytics**
## Background：
There is insufficient trust between the creator and the organization. For example, in the Indonesian market, 95% of creators are unwilling to provide their accounts directly to the organization. As a result, the partner does not have enough data to assist the creators in optimizing the live.
90% of the creators and partners have remote contact. The MCN hopes to view the data through the portal to achieve real-time guidance to the creators.
## Problem We Solve：
Without obtaining the creator's account and log in to the streamer desktop to obtain the creator's LIVE data to help the creator to optimize the operation strategy
When the partner‘s creator starts LIVE, clicks/number partner can achieve the real-time guide for creator
## Key Function：

* Partner portal live screen: support to view live & real-time data of multiple creators at the same time
* Review the live data: support viewing the historical live data of its creators
* Authorization of the creator data：live streamlive streamsclicks/numberlogginga the live streams,Only after the partner obtains the permission of the creator data, it can check the data of its creators
