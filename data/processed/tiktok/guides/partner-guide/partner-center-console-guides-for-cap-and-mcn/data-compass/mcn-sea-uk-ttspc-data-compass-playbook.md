# Data Function Introduction：
We have introduced a new Content Type Based GMV Attribution where GMV will be attributed to the last content type that a buyer clicked on when checking out a product. As such, across the Analytics pages, transaction related metrics (e.g. Direct GMV, Orders, C_O, GPM, Buyers) for LIVE/ Video will now be updated to reflect the logic change.
**++LIVE++**++ ++**++Direct GMV & Video Direct GMV++**

* You'll now see **LIVE** **Direct GMV and Video Direct GMV metrics** which previously were not available and are calculated using the **Content Type Based GMV Attribution**
* LIVE Direct GMV and Video Direct GMV refer to the total amount paid for orders that are placed directly from creator's LIVE or Video, including returns and refunds. This means that GMV is only tabulated based on the last clicked LIVE/VIDEO.
* Therefore, LIVE Direct GMV and Video Direct GMV are indicators of how effective a livestream or video is in directly **driving conversions and sales**

**No change:** 100% of Affiliate GMV = LIVE + Video + Showcase

* The way commission is calculated for creators will **++not++** change
* The Affiliate GMV allows you to track the **overall GMV performance,** and takes into account attributed GMV as well. Traditionally, this is what is used to calculate your commission and, as there are no changes to this, this means there will be no changes to how your commission is calculated**.**

## Q&A

1. Why is it impossible to see video details for some video?
* Videos, whose status are set to private or deleted, do not support playback and cannot display video pictures;
* Videos, whose status are set to private and have never been made public, have no transaction or content data;
2. Why are the recommended videos with high revenue not shown in the transaction analysis in the video detail page?
* For videos with multiple product links, you need to select one product in the video detail page-transaction analysis, and the video of the TOP3 revenue amount in all videos (including the Creator/Merchants' own short video and other Creator/Merchants' short videos) with the same product will be displayed below the transaction analysis.
