# **How to use Custom Report in your Partner Center**
## Entrance
Authorized users can access and use Custom Report by navigating to **Partner Center > Analytics > Custom Report**
<div style="text-align: center"><img src="https://p16-arcosite-va.ibyteimg.com/tos-maliva-i-10qhjjqwgv-us/c39b00dc84e2409185b35a90a74aca9f~tplv-10qhjjqwgv-image.image" width="903px" /></div>

## Usage and access considerations

1. If an agency provides TSP or MCN/CAP services as well as the TAP services, they will need to change their service category to MCN/CAP to be able to view metrics for CAP related data.
   1. *For example*: If an agency is registered as a TAP and MCN/CAP in US region, they must choose between TAP and MCN/CAP service categories to be able to view the relevant data
2. The region in Custom Report will not automatically be the same as the region selected on other tabs of the Analytics section.
   1. *For example*: An agency is registered as an ++MCN/CAP++ in both MY and ID. While viewing data in the Video Analytics tab, they switch their region from ID to MY. However, when they open the Custom Report tab, the region will revert back to ID instead of remaining consistent with the region they were viewing in the Video Analytics tab.

## **Using Dimensions**
Dimensions are logical groupings of important and relevant metrics. Within the Dimensions section, you can select a number of different dimensions. Dimensions correspond to the headings displayed in your search results.

1. **Time Dimension** — Here, you can select from **one of the below.** Select a particular **time dimension** to aggregate results by the selected dimension range.
   1. By Day
   2. By Week (starting on Monday)
   3. By Month
   4. All Time (is selected by default in the time dimension)

<div style="text-align: center"><img src="https://p16-arcosite-va.ibyteimg.com/tos-maliva-i-10qhjjqwgv-us/02066ca79d2d4cba957f5baadd07bb12~tplv-10qhjjqwgv-image.image" width="2216px" /></div>


2. **Other Dimensions** — you can **multi-select** any of the below. The only exception is that LIVE and Video cannot be selected together.

Note: When you select each dimension, **all the types associated with that dimension** are automatically selected. All associated metrics will also be displayed in the grid view.
At a later time, users will also be able to select individual metrics within the selected dimensions to have an even more relevant view of the metrics of interest.
| At present, the following dimensions will be available for authorized CAP users. | The following dimensions will be available for TAP users. |
| --- | --- |
| 1. Creator <br> 2. LIVE <br> 3. Video <br> 4. Product <br> 5. Shop <br> 6. Product Category | 1. Campaign <br> 2. Creator <br> 3. LIVE <br> 4. Video <br> 5. Product <br> 6. Shop <br> 7. Product Category |
*After selection of the required dimensions, the number of associated underlying metrics will be displayed and will dynamically change as the selected dimension combination changes.*
<div style="text-align: center"><img src="https://p16-arcosite-va.ibyteimg.com/tos-maliva-i-10qhjjqwgv-us/d452a2b617a44158ba457dc5398b4674~tplv-10qhjjqwgv-image.image" width="2227px" /></div>

## **Using Filters**
Filters can help you better refine search results. You can select from the time filter as well as the categories, as detailed below.

      2. Last 28 days
   3. **Time comparison** — this checkbox is available when the "**All time**" dimension is selected.
      1. The tool provides a default time comparison range, and you can customize it to any period within the last 6 months and before the base time range you select.
      2. Comparison data is displayed below the raw data in red/green to indicate increases/decreases. This data can also be exported as an Excel file.
