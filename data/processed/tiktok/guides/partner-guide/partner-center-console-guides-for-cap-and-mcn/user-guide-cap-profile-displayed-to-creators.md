With this feature, creators can now assess the suitability of an MCN/TAP partner by reviewing details such as the categories and products they promote, as well as key performance metrics like data and commission rates. This will help to:

1. Strengthen trust in MCN/TAP partners, as the data is directly pulled from the platform.
2. Improve matchmaking by empowering creators to evaluate partners using relevant data, while aligning with their specific needs.
