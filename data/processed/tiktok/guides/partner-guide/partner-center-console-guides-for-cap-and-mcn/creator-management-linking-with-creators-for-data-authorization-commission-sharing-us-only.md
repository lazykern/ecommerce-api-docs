# Overview
We are making collecting management fees from creators a more seamless experience by including commission sharing as part of our onboarding process in the TikTok Shop Partner Center. You can now link accounts, authorize data sharing, and set up commission sharing in a single request. It's now even easier to start working with your creators and earn revenue sooner.
When setting up a creator relationship, you'll establish the fee agreement rate you're taking from the creator's TikTok Shop commission as a management fee, also known as commission sharing. The fee agreement starts once the creator accepts the linking request. You can change the fee rate anytime by submitting an adjustment request requiring creator confirmation.
## Changelog
**3/20**

* New Filter to allow agencies to see Creator Links expiring in 1, 15, and 30 days.
* Agencies can now request to extend one additional time if a creator hasn't responded to the first 7-day extension window
* Agencies can now add up to 100 new creators per day in TTSPC (previously 30).

# Onboarding
Step 1: In order to set up commission sharing, you will first need to provide your tax and payment information. If you are a new agency, you will see the page shown below. In the Creator Manager section, click on the **Manage Partnerships** tab, then click on **Go to Finance**.
<div style="text-align: center"><img src="https://p16-arcosite-va.ibyteimg.com/tos-maliva-i-10qhjjqwgv-us/5a8531f74be641478778ec8a8c0f63eb~tplv-10qhjjqwgv-image.image" width="1662px" /></div>

Step 2: If you are an existing agency that has linked with Creators in the past, you will see the following page below with Request fee agreement greyed out. In this case, navigate to the Tax information page as shown and press **Complete now** to follow the required steps.
<div style="text-align: center"><img src="https://p16-arcosite-va.ibyteimg.com/tos-maliva-i-10qhjjqwgv-us/62c0f3462f684362adb484391a1f3f99~tplv-10qhjjqwgv-image.image" width="2066px" /></div>

<div style="text-align: center"><img src="https://p16-arcosite-va.ibyteimg.com/tos-maliva-i-10qhjjqwgv-us/080525266a614d36b76b242900e69aef~tplv-10qhjjqwgv-image.image" width="1662px" /></div>

Step 3: After providing tax information, you will need to provide payment information. In the Manage Partnerships page, click on **Go activate**.
<div style="text-align: center"><img src="https://p16-arcosite-va.ibyteimg.com/tos-maliva-i-10qhjjqwgv-us/fb5a9ce964e647ff9ad71ba85b822621~tplv-10qhjjqwgv-image.image" width="2070px" /></div>

Step 4: In the Payment Account page, press **Activate account** and follow the required steps.
<div style="text-align: center"><img src="https://p16-arcosite-va.ibyteimg.com/tos-maliva-i-10qhjjqwgv-us/d94c01465164427e97083e4e7022926f~tplv-10qhjjqwgv-image.image" width="2070px" /></div>

# Linking with Creators for Data Authorization & Commission Sharing
Step 1: In the Creator Manager section, click on the Manage Partnerships tab, then click on **Add New Creators**.
<div style="text-align: center"><img src="https://p16-arcosite-va.ibyteimg.com/tos-maliva-i-10qhjjqwgv-us/07fb367689f243eab71835c1499b3b8b~tplv-10qhjjqwgv-image.image" width="4320px" /></div>

Step 2: Add the Creator’s **User Name** and select a **Link Expiration Date**, which can’t be changed. The first time you link with a Creator, the maximum linking duration is two months, and if you link with them again, it can be one year. By linking with a Creator, you will gain access to their data in Data Compass. Next, enter the **Fee Agreement** rate (between 1-100%). This is the management fee percent that you are taking from the creator's commission. The fee agreement will start once the creator accepts the request and the percentage can be changed later by submitting an adjustment request, which requires confirmation from you and the creator. Click the **checkbox** and press **Add**.
<div style="text-align: center"><img src="https://p16-arcosite-va.ibyteimg.com/tos-maliva-i-10qhjjqwgv-us/e4f68571239a46eba4e8fe47dcbb5456~tplv-10qhjjqwgv-image.image" width="632px" /></div>

Step 3: Once you have added the link request, it will appear on the Manage Partnerships page, under the **Link requested** tab, showing the Creator's handle and a Link requested status. Link requests expire after 7 days. The fee agreement will also show as pending, and you can click on **View history** to view the commission sharing percentage history.
<div style="text-align: center"><img src="https://p16-arcosite-va.ibyteimg.com/tos-maliva-i-10qhjjqwgv-us/da0a23c458c04573bf509f610a19b055~tplv-10qhjjqwgv-image.image" width="4320px" /></div>

<div style="text-align: center"><img src="https://p16-arcosite-va.ibyteimg.com/tos-maliva-i-10qhjjqwgv-us/e5effbcda5df4c28a806464e86d67b10~tplv-10qhjjqwgv-image.image" width="568px" /></div>

Step 4: Once the Creator has accepted the link request, the status will update to **Linked** and the Creator will be shown in the **Linked** tab. Here, you will also see the **Fee agreement** will be updated to the agreed upon percentage.
<div style="text-align: center"><img src="https://p16-arcosite-va.ibyteimg.com/tos-maliva-i-10qhjjqwgv-us/587bb8948056428f957b6fa0bda84fbb~tplv-10qhjjqwgv-image.image" width="4320px" /></div>

Step 5: If the Creator declines the linking request, then the status will update to **Not linked - link declined** and the Creator will be shown in the **Not linked** tab. The Fee agreement will also be shown as **Declined**. You can try to link again by clicking on **Request again**.
<div style="text-align: center"><img src="https://p16-arcosite-va.ibyteimg.com/tos-maliva-i-10qhjjqwgv-us/226bb0d098c542bdb3c6c4d4fa0af772~tplv-10qhjjqwgv-image.image" width="4320px" /></div>

Step 6: If the Creator does not respond to the link request, it will expire after 7 days. You can try to link again by clicking on **Request again**.
<div style="text-align: center"><img src="https://p16-arcosite-va.ibyteimg.com/tos-maliva-i-10qhjjqwgv-us/ce2b51feedef4f07a94d9c8fb9a5c4a9~tplv-10qhjjqwgv-image.image" width="4320px" /></div>

Note: Agencies can only send 100 Link Requests to Creators each day.
## Linking with Agency (Creator Experience)
Step 1: In the **Partnerships** page or **Notifications** page, Creators will see a notification for a new link request to click on and view the details. Here, the Creator must accept that they understand they’ll be sharing their data and that they will be sharing revenue with the agency **** by clicking the checkboxes and pressing **Accept**. Once accepted, the Creator will see the linking and revenue sharing details and can also choose to unlink from the agency.

Note: We recommend that creators set up offline contracts with agencies that specify the percentage of TTS commission that will go towards the agency, and we recommend that the duration of these offline contracts aligns with the duration that is specified on the linking invitation.

# Extending Agency-Creator Links
Step 1: Agencies will see a countdown starting 30 days before the Agency-Creator link expires. To see a list of which Agency-Creator links are about to expire in next 30/15/1 day, select the **Expiring** filter (see Example 1). At this time, the agency can click on **Extend** and set a new expiration date for the link request, which can’t last for more than one year. Once a new expiration date has been set, press the checkbox and then press **Submit**.
![Image](https://p16-arcosite-va.ibyteimg.com/tos-maliva-i-10qhjjqwgv-us/4a23a8e7ed934b65b972e41ae831b6d0~tplv-10qhjjqwgv-image.image)

Example 1
Step 2: If the Creator declines the extension request, the Agency won’t be able to request an extension again. If the Creator doesn’t respond to the extension request within 7 days, an Agency can send one more extension request to the Creator before the Link expires.
<div style="text-align: center"><img src="https://p16-arcosite-va.ibyteimg.com/tos-maliva-i-10qhjjqwgv-us/19ea70dacb534b1a9fe3834d5b299b62~tplv-10qhjjqwgv-image.image" width="1280px" /></div>

## Accepting Extension Requests (Creator Experience)
Step 1: Once the Agency has submitted an extension request, the Creator will receive a notification in the Partnerships page or Notification page. The Creator must confirm that they understand they’ll be sharing their data and then click on **Accept**.

# Unlinking with Creators
Step 1: You can unlink with a Creator by clicking on **Remove.**
<div style="text-align: center"><img src="https://p16-arcosite-va.ibyteimg.com/tos-maliva-i-10qhjjqwgv-us/6c7a5911ef9d4900b5515cb131558296~tplv-10qhjjqwgv-image.image" width="4320px" /></div>

Step 2: Once the Creator has unlinked, the status will update to **Not linked - unlinked**. The agency can choose to send another linking request by clicking on **Request again**.
<div style="text-align: center"><img src="https://p16-arcosite-va.ibyteimg.com/tos-maliva-i-10qhjjqwgv-us/6f54fb0d65844bb5895c35c1daf88aac~tplv-10qhjjqwgv-image.image" width="4320px" /></div>

Step 3: If the Creator is the one who initiates the unlinking request, the agency can **Approve** or **Decline** it in the **Unlink requested** tab.
<div style="text-align: center"><img src="https://p16-arcosite-va.ibyteimg.com/tos-maliva-i-10qhjjqwgv-us/640905ee4b794825ac09889f57ffd667~tplv-10qhjjqwgv-image.image" width="1280px" /></div>

## Unlinking with Agencies (Creator Experience)
Step 1: If the Creator would like to initiate an unlinking request, they can go to the Partnerships Page, click on **View details**, then click on **Unlink**.
![Image](https://p16-arcosite-va.ibyteimg.com/tos-maliva-i-10qhjjqwgv-us/3d560001dcd24124b9a2fa2d87b35693~tplv-10qhjjqwgv-image.image)

Step 2: If the agency declines the unlinking request, then the Creator will receive a notification that it has been declined and they can resend an unlinking request. If the Creator sends an unlink request a second time and the agency declines it or does not respond within 7 days, then it will be automatically approved.

# FAQ

1. **What happens if I'm already linked to a creator?**
   1. If you are already linked to a creator, you will need to set up the new fee agreement by pressing **Request fee agreement**. Then set a new fee agreement rate, which is the management fee percent that you are taking from the creator's commission (between 1-100%) and click the checkbox and **Submit**.

![Image](https://p16-arcosite-va.ibyteimg.com/tos-maliva-i-10qhjjqwgv-us/0657f6d27ddf49da8bc3500aa1116c2b~tplv-10qhjjqwgv-image.image)

2. If you are already linked to a creator, but the link is about to expire within 30 days, then you must press **Extend**. Then set a new Link Expiration date (up to one year in the future) and fee agreement rate, which is the management fee percent that you are taking from the creator's commission (between 1-100%) and click the checkbox and **Submit**.

![Image](https://p16-arcosite-va.ibyteimg.com/tos-maliva-i-10qhjjqwgv-us/1a8817d907fb441da0769f7255aef3fd~tplv-10qhjjqwgv-image.image)

2. **What should I do if I am only partially linked to a creator?**
   1. Navigate to the **Not linked** tab and press Extend. Then choose a **Link Expiration date** that can be up to a year in the future. The Data Sharing Period will auto-update to align with the chosen Link Expiration date. Then, choose a **New Fee Agreement Rate,** which is the management fee percent that you are taking from the creator's commission (between 1-100%) and press **Submit**.

2. The creator will receive an **Extend partnership** **and revenue sharing** request and will need to click the checkboxes and press **Accept** and **Share** for you to be linked with the creator. If the creator does not accept the request, then you will remain partially linked with the creator until the expiration date.

<div style="text-align: center"><img src="https://p16-arcosite-va.ibyteimg.com/tos-maliva-i-10qhjjqwgv-us/61863f342915490b82493453be565d80~tplv-10qhjjqwgv-image.image" width="391px" /></div>


3. **I am not able to change the fee agreement percent. Why?**
   1. If you're not able to change the fee agreement percent, it is likely because the creator has not accepted the Terms of Service yet. In this case, you will see the fee agreement percent show as 100% and you will not be able to press submit.

<div style="text-align: center"><img src="https://p16-arcosite-va.ibyteimg.com/tos-maliva-i-10qhjjqwgv-us/e595e3cc5eab49c0aea87678cb5247e4~tplv-10qhjjqwgv-image.image" width="1228px" /></div>


4. **I am not able to add additional Creators. Why?**
   1. If you're not able to add additional Creators, it may be because you have already sent 100 invites today. If you are unable to add specific Creators, it may be because they have declined your request recently.
