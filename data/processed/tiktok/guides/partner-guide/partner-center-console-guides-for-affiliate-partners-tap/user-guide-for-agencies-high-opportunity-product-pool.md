As a TikTok Affiliate Program (TAP) agency, finding products that are likely to perform well across different campaign types takes time. The High opportunity product pool helps solve this problem.
## What It Is
The High opportunity product pool is an aggregator tool that brings together products with strong sales and commission potential from all campaign types - Seller, Agency, Exclusive TikTok shop, and more.
## Key Features and Benefits

1. **Find Products That Perform**: Access carefully selected products from all your campaigns in one tab. Instead of searching through multiple campaign types separately, you'll spot promising products quickly.
2. **Choose Products With Confidence**: See products from different campaigns side-by-side and easily identify ones with attractive commission rates. Add them to your campaigns with just a few clicks.
3. **Run Better Campaigns**: Focus on products chosen for their performance potential. Add them to your campaigns easily and spend less time searching for good options.
4. **Work Well with Creators**: Give products to creators and set their commission rates in one place. Create and share product lists directly through the platform instead of sending individual links from different campaign types.

## How it works
**Step 1:** If you already have a TikTok Shop Partner Center account, navigate to Product Management and select high opportunity products. You will be able to search for products by name/id/shopname/shopcode/campaign name/campaign id

**Creator's Experience:** If you send the creator a product list, they will see a list of products. If you send them just one product, they will see that single product.
