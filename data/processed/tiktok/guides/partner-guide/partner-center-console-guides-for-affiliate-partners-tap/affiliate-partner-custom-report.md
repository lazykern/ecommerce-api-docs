This guide outlines how to access the new Custom Report feature that will be available in the Analytics section of the Partner Center. Below, we explain how you can use this feature to export data so you can see the success of creators and sellers participating in your campaigns.
# **Overview**
Custom Report is a new feature within the Analytics section that has been designed specifically to help Affiliate Partners effortlessly access and export data so it can be viewed in Excel. This will help you better visualize the data and perform any necessary additional analysis in Excel, which can ultimately aid you in devising effective long-term strategies for future campaigns.

# **How to use Custom Report in your Partner Center**
Go to: **Partner Center > Analytics > Custom Report**
There are several sections within Custom Report, which we delve into below to help you understand how to effectively use this feature to export data.
Note:

1. If an agency provides TSP or MCN/CAP services as well as the TAP services, at present they will only be able to see the Custom Report data in the region their TAP service is linked to.
   1. For example: If an agency is registered as an MCN/CAP in both MY and ID but is registered as an Affiliate Partner in MY only, then they will only be able to open the Custom Report page in MY region.
2. The region in Custom Report will not automatically be the same as the region selected on other tabs of the Analytics section.
   1. For example: An agency is registered as an ++MCN/CAP and Affiliate Partner++ in both MY and ID. While viewing data in the Video Analytics tab, they switch their region from ID to MY. However, when they open the Custom Report tab, the region will revert back to ID instead of remaining consistent with the region they were viewing in the Video Analytics tab.

## **Using Dimensions**
Within the Dimensions section, you can select a number of different dimensions. Dimensions correspond to the headings displayed in your search results.

1. **Time Dimension** — Here, you can select from **one of the below.**
   1. By Day
   2. By Week (starting on Sunday)
   3. By Month
   4. By Entire Period (extends 6 months into the past and is selected by default when the time dimension is checked)

1. **Other Dimensions** — you can **multi-select** any of the below. The only exception is that LIVE and Video cannot be selected together.

Note: When you select each dimension, **all the types associated with that dimension** are automatically selected and will be displayed in your results.
| **Dimension** | **Types** |
| --- | --- |
| Campaign | Campaign ID, Campaign name, Campaign status, Campaign validation, Campaign time info |

## **Using Filters**
Filters can help you better refine search results. You can select from the time filter as well as the categories, as detailed below.

1. **Creator Handle, Product ID, Shop ID, Campaign ID filters** — each of these 4 filters supports single search as well as batch input. With batch input, you can separate each item by a comma and paste a maximum of 500 items per filter.
   1. You can select whether you want to **Include or Exclude** the items you have pasted for each filter.
   2. This section is useful as it allows you to refine your results so that the data displayed will only be for the items you have added into the filters.
