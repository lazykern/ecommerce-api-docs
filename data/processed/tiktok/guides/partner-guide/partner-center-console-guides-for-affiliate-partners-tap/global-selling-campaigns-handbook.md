Generally, for an agency to successfully join a Global Selling Campaign, there are mainly 4 steps: 1. Add TAP category; 2. Create a product list from a campaign for your creators; 3. Ask your creators to add products from your product list and create contents; 4. View campaign performance and earn commissions. Below is detailed step-by-step guidance.
### How to Add TAP Category?

* For cross-border partners, Lianlian payment and Chinese bank account (for corporate) are supported.
* For local partners, bank accounts are supported.

### How to Manage Primary Partnership Relationships with Self-Incubated Creators?
> Note: *++(This feature is only supported by whitelisted partners++*) If the primary partnership is built, the agency can set the commission to 0.

This step is only for agencies who have in-house creators and needs to set 0 commission for their own creators. If you don't have in-house creators, feel free to skip this step. Participating in Global Selling Campaigns doesn't necessarily require this step.
#### Adding a Self-Incubated Collaboration Relationship
Step 1: partners should open "**Creator Management**" > **"Manage Partnership**" from the sidebar and click on "**Manage exclusive partnership**."
<div style="text-align: center"><img src="https://p16-arcosite-va.ibyteimg.com/tos-maliva-i-10qhjjqwgv-us/a354ad33ef06436db3b691cf27017fa6~tplv-10qhjjqwgv-image.image" width="2346px" /></div>

**Step 2**: In the dropdown menu, partners can search for the already linked creator accounts (supporting multiple selections, up to 10 at a time) and click "**Request**" to submit the request. After submission, partners can check whether the creator accepts the invitation. **++The invitation is valid for 7 days++**.
![Image](https://p16-arcosite-va.ibyteimg.com/tos-maliva-i-10qhjjqwgv-us/962361842ab84b3d9ee4c0d6c0dff0c0~tplv-10qhjjqwgv-image.image)
![Image](https://p16-arcosite-va.ibyteimg.com/tos-maliva-i-10qhjjqwgv-us/e51e670c01c54f19b39c1baa422cd79b~tplv-10qhjjqwgv-image.image)
Once the creator accepts the invitation, the status will change from "Requested" to "Accepted."
**Step 3: Creator Accepts the Invitation on the TikTok App**
| **Step-by-step guide** | **Demo of Creator Side** |
| --- | --- |
| 1. Creators will receive the invitation through three channels on the TikTok App: Inbox, Notification Center, and Partnerships. They need to accept the invitation within 7 days, or the invitation will expire. | ![Image](https://p16-arcosite-va.ibyteimg.com/tos-maliva-i-10qhjjqwgv-us/0414b7fcf6e944c882098406f48af8a1~tplv-10qhjjqwgv-image.image) <br> ![Image](https://p16-arcosite-va.ibyteimg.com/tos-maliva-i-10qhjjqwgv-us/ef542a9ae593480580cf89ed35af9bee~tplv-10qhjjqwgv-image.image) <br> ![Image](https://p16-arcosite-va.ibyteimg.com/tos-maliva-i-10qhjjqwgv-us/d47afa0de16d48ecb5239bd10a60a375~tplv-10qhjjqwgv-image.image) <br>  |
| 2. By clicking on the message, creators will enter the partnership confirmation page, where they can review the partner's name, binding validity period, partnership validity period (from the binding start date to the end of the binding validity period), partnership details. After reviewing, they can check the agreement box, click "Accept" to accept the invitation. | ![Image](https://p16-arcosite-va.ibyteimg.com/tos-maliva-i-10qhjjqwgv-us/88f1499910fb4e2494981cd9d036143a~tplv-10qhjjqwgv-image.image) <br> ![Image](https://p16-arcosite-va.ibyteimg.com/tos-maliva-i-10qhjjqwgv-us/7db9e18788ef4b4f8eabae1f6780feee~tplv-10qhjjqwgv-image.image) |
#### Ending the Primary Partnerships
Partners can cancel the "Self-Incubated Collaboration Relationship" with creators within the partnership validity period **without needing the creator's consent**.
**Step 1**: Partners should open "**Creator Manager**" > "**Manage Partnerships**" from the sidebar and click on "**Manage exclusive partnership**" in the top right corner.
<div style="text-align: center"><img src="https://p16-arcosite-va.ibyteimg.com/tos-maliva-i-10qhjjqwgv-us/67744c0248cb44d78b4f8e5c3386d831~tplv-10qhjjqwgv-image.image" width="2346px" /></div>

**Step 2**: In the list, locate the creator with whom the relationship needs to be terminated. Click on the delete icon on the right side and confirm the action by clicking the "End" button in the pop-up window.

> ***++Note: If the termination is successful, the partner will no longer be able to set a 0 commission activity for that creator.++***

**Step 3: The creator will receive a notification of the termination, and no action is required on their part.**
<div style="text-align: center"><img src="https://p16-arcosite-va.ibyteimg.com/tos-maliva-i-10qhjjqwgv-us/0d864a73bf9e411f975d78664e87830f~tplv-10qhjjqwgv-image.image" width="762px" /></div>

* Confirm the deletion in the pop-up window. After successful deletion, creators will no longer see the product list, but it will not affect the products already displayed in showcases and short videos.

**Step 5: Duplicate a product list**
By duplicating a product list, you can easily create the same product list for different creators, and add or delete products and modify commissions based on the original list to improve the efficiency.

1. There are two ways to start a duplication: a. Find the list you want to duplicate in the Product List view, click the "more" (three dots) button on the right, and select "Duplicate list". b. Or you can click "Duplicate list" in the upper right corner on a product list detail page to start duplicating

<div style="text-align: center"><img src="https://p16-arcosite-va.ibyteimg.com/tos-maliva-i-10qhjjqwgv-us/a4f4711744904ebe919efee80f1ff32c~tplv-10qhjjqwgv-image.image" width="1303px" /></div>

2. Fill in the new list name in the pop-up side window, edit the products and commissions, and then click preview to preview and create the list (same as creating a list).

<div style="text-align: center"><img src="https://p16-arcosite-va.ibyteimg.com/tos-maliva-i-10qhjjqwgv-us/405f0be3657f43e2b53be30fa7199f87~tplv-10qhjjqwgv-image.image" width="363px" /></div>

### How do creators add products and apply for samples?
**Step 1: Open the product list link provided by the partner to launch the TikTok app and browse the products.**

* On the page, you can view the list name, partner name, and the activity's validity period.
* The product list supports sorting by commission rate (high to low), price (high to low or low to high), and sales volume (high to low).
* You can click on "**Requested sample**" to filter and view products for which you have applied for free samples.

**Step 2: Add products to the showcase**
You can add products to the showcase in three ways. When adding, the system will verify if the commission rate for this collaboration is lower than any ongoing collaborations. If it is lower, the system will provide a prompt, and after confirmation, you can proceed with the addition. If the commission rate is higher for this collaboration or there are no other ongoing collaborations, the product will be automatically added successfully.

> ***Note: If a creator has already applied for a sample of the same product through other channels, they cannot apply again. (The partner can see if the creator has already applied for a sample of that product.)***

### How to apply free samples for collaborated creators?
After the creator added products from your product list, if they meet the sample application requirements, TAP agencies can request the creators' consent to apply for free samples on behalf of the creator and monitor the content posting.
**Step 1 Apply for the consent from the creator (only consent to apply for samples, not a binding relationship)**
| **Detailed steps** | **Demo** |
| --- | --- |
| 1. Click the "Sample management" tab under Campaign details. Under the "Creator authorization" module, you can see creators under Unauthorized, Authorized, Pending, Removed, and Rejected. <br>  <br> > Only those creators who have already added products to the showcase from the TAP's product list will appear here. | ![Image](https://p16-arcosite-va.ibyteimg.com/tos-maliva-i-10qhjjqwgv-us/172e9bb7717b4498aa1ef7b69734e40e~tplv-10qhjjqwgv-image.image) |
| 2. By clicking the "Filter" button, you can filter creators based on the category, basic information, number of followers, performance, etc., and select those who are suitable to apply for free samples. | ![Image](https://p16-arcosite-va.ibyteimg.com/tos-maliva-i-10qhjjqwgv-us/30ed1b40ce2546849c8a9473a1d5fdc0~tplv-10qhjjqwgv-image.image) |
| 3. Click "Request authorization" on the right side of the creator to request authorization. After clicking, the creator will receive the authorization request in the TikTok app. | ![Image](https://p16-arcosite-va.ibyteimg.com/tos-maliva-i-10qhjjqwgv-us/64c25fe2250744e1b2e40608a2ea64e7~tplv-10qhjjqwgv-image.image) <br> ![Image](https://p16-arcosite-va.ibyteimg.com/tos-maliva-i-10qhjjqwgv-us/7ae3497a5e894aba92fbddc009b173a1~tplv-10qhjjqwgv-image.image) |
| 3. The creator will find the invitation within a notification in the TikTok App Creator Center.

### FAQ

1. **What type of orders can TAP agencies earn commissions from?**

TAP agencies can only earn commissions from:

* Orders from videos that are posted **AFTER** creators collaborate with the agency; (the link on videos posted before collaboration will not be changed to TAP link and will not pay commissions to TAP agencies.)
* Orders from creators' showcase and live that are paid after creators collaborate with the agency.
