# Summary
Creators can now share affiliate links on external platforms to boost commissions. As such, it is important for TAP agencies to monitor their creators' affiliate link performances to optimise this new channel of commission generation. With that, we have introduced a new module called **Links** that allows TAP agencies to quickly grasp creators' overall affiliate links performances.
To get a quick refresher of how affiliate links work for Creators, feel free to read the flowchart below:

# Benefits of Monitoring Affiliate Link Performance

1. **Identify Creators' Link channels with high traffic** to guide Creators in optimising the relevant traffic channels to boost commission.
2. **Easily view overall Affiliate Links attribution towards key metrics like GMV, Orders, Est. Commission and more** to understand the effectiveness of affiliate links for Creators.
3. **Engage with Creators with a custom performance report** where you can analyse how Affiliate Links impact different dimensions and form a different affiliate link strategy for each Creator.
