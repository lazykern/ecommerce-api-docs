## Educate Creators to submit sample requests by themselves
Creators can now request samples for all campaign types, as long as they meet the eligibility criteria for sample requests specific to each campaign. TAP Agencies are encouraged to prompt Creators to request samples directly, as this enhances sample management efficiency and match rates. By allowing Creators to handle requests independently, TAP Agencies can avoid delays caused by waiting for Creator authorization and eliminate the need to speculate on specific product variants Creators wish to showcase.

* Creators can go to the TikTok Shop Creator Center, navigate to the Affiliate partner Product list, and find the extra commission earnings when creators join a TAP campaign (compared to the open plan commissions) displayed on the product card above the product price.
* Click the "gift" icon on the top right corner of the Product list page to enter the "Manage samples" page.
