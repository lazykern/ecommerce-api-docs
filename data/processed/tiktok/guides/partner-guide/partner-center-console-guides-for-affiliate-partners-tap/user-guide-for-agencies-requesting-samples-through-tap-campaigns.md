# Overview
Agencies can now request samples on behalf of their linked creators for Partner Campaigns. Once an agency gets creator authorization, they can review the number of samples a seller has allocated for an SKU and determine which creator they want to share that sample with to create a streamlined experience in product.
# How to Request Samples
## Agency Experience
**Step 1**: Navigate to [TikTok Shop Partner Center](https://partner.tiktokshop.com/account/login?) and log in with your credentials.
**Step 2:** Under the "**Partner Campaigns**" section, select "**View Details**" for the campaign you would like to request samples for.

**Step 3**: Navigate to the "**Sample Management**" tab and select "**Creator Authorization**" where you are able to see a list of creators and their current authorization status. Before you can request samples for a creator, a creator must first agree to your authorization request to let you pass along their preferred address to sellers to receive a sample.
**Sample Status:**
**Unauthorized**: You have not requested authorization from the creator yet
**Pending**: The creator has not responded to your request
**Authorized**: The creator has responded and agreed to your authorization request
**Ended**: The creator was previously authorized
**Rejected**: The creator rejected the previous authorization request

**Note**: In order for a creator to be eligible and show up on the Creator Authorization tab, they must add a product from the Partner Campaign to their product showcase.
**Step 4**: You can individually request authorization from a creator by selecting the "**Request Authorization**" to the right of their name under the "**Action**" column.
If you would like to bulk request authorization for creators, make sure to select all of the creators first by clicking the box to the left of their name and then select the "**Request Authorization**" button at the top of the creator list.

**Step 5**: After a creator approves your authorization request, you can now request samples on their behalf. Select the "**Available Sample**" tab to see a list of creators that you can request samples for. Then select "**Order Samples**" for the specific creator you would like to order samples for.
<div style="text-align: center"><img src="https://p16-arcosite-va.ibyteimg.com/tos-maliva-i-10qhjjqwgv-us/761cae071b81443f89432a34f4a01cc4~tplv-10qhjjqwgv-image.image" width="2790px" /></div>

If you would like to filter the creator list, you can do so using the "**Filter**" option and selecting the relevant fields you would like to filter by.

**Step 6**: You will now be able to see what samples this creator is eligible for. Under the "**Available Sample**" section, you will see the total available samples for this product. Once you know which sample, you would like to order, select "**Order**" under the "**Action**" column.
If the "**Available Sample**" is 0, you will not be able to order any additional samples for this product on behalf of the creator. This is because of one of the reasons below:

1. The seller listed product is out of stock
2. You have run out of available samples to share with creators. However, you can reach out to the seller to see if they are willing to update the number of samples available for this campaign.

**Step 7**: Confirm the product details and select "**Order**". You will see a confirmation once you have successfully ordered a sample and it will be shipped directly to the creator.

## Creator Experience
**Creator Authorization Request**
When an agency requests authorization from a creator, the creator will receive a notification. The creator will then be able to see the "**Authorization Request**" details and decide if they want to accept or decline the request. If the creator wants to accept the request, they will need to provide their preferred shipping address and then select "**Accept**". If the creator wants to stop being eligible to receive samples on behalf of an agency, they can view the authorization details and select "**End this authorization**".
| Notification for the creator | Details about the authorization request | Input the shipping address | End this authorization |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

If a creator wants to update their default sample address, they will need to navigate to the original "**Sample Authorization Request**" and tap on the shipping address. From there, they can select "**Edit**" to change their shipping information. After they have updated their shipping information, they can then choose to "**Use For This Agency Only**" or "**Use For All Agencies**" in the event that they have multiple authorizations with different agencies.

**Agency Ordered a Sample for a Creator**
