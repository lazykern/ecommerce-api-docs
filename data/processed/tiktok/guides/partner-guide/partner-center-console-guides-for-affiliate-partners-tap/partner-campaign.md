### 2.Affiliate Campaign
#### Affiliate Campaign Description
Affiliate Campaign is the key feature for Affiliate Partners to recruit products and earn commission. The main workflow is as follows:
**Step1 Affiliate Partner creates a campaign and guides sellers to view campaign and register products**
Affiliate Partner can create campaigns for targeted sellers/public sellers, including campaign registration time, promotion time and commission requirements. Affiliate Partner guides sellers to view campaigns and register products in the seller center
**Step 2 After the cooperation is reached, during the product promotion time, Affiliate partner can copy the product link and promote it with creators.**
After the Affiliate Partner has reviewed and approved the registered products of the sellers, Affiliate Partner can distribute product links and distribute them to the creators offline.
**Step 3 After the creator accepts and adds the product to the showcase to sell , affiliate partner can earn commission from the sold order.**
After the creator adds the product link and sells goods, the affiliate partner can earn the commission set by the merchant
##### <span style="color: rgb(216, 57, 49)">[IMPT] Commission Calculation Logic</span>
<span style="color: rgb(216, 57, 49)">There are three partnership models and each has its own commission calculation logic. Below are illustrations of how they operate.</span>

1. <span style="color: rgb(216, 57, 49)"><strong>Affiliate Partners</strong></span>

> Partnership with Non-binding creators.

<span style="color: rgb(216, 57, 49)">Commission Calculation: All commission rates of products will be calculated based on the commission split setup during link creation by the agency before sharing it with creators</span>

2. **Agencies functioning as both Creator Management Agency (MCN/CAP) and Affiliate Partners (TAP)**

> In this scenario, creators are bound with a MCN/CAP Agency, and add Campaign Product links from the same agency who also works as a TAP partner to their showcases.

Commission calculation: The agency takes both the TAP commission from Campaign Commission, as well as the CAP/MCN commission based on the Commission Sharing Agreement signed with the binding Creators.
> What this means: If a creator has a commission sharing relationship with MCN/CAP Agency, the commission for the creator will be shared with MCN/CAP Agency based on the commission sharing rate with MCN/CAP Agency.
> *For example: If a* *Seller* *sets a total commission of 20% for a product, dividing it as 10% for the affiliate partner (as a TAP Agency) and 10% for the Creator, and the Creator has a 50% commission-sharing arrangement signed with the same affiliate partner (as a MCN/CAP Agency), the Creator will effectively receive 5% commission.*

#### Step 1 Create Campaign
After completing the settle-in process and active account as an Affiliate Partner, you can log in to the TTSPC, and create campaign through **[Campaign] ➤ [My Campaign] ➤ [Create Campaign]**.

<span style="color: rgb(216, 57, 49)"><strong>Q: Why is the commission for some of the products on the Finance page zero even though we have fee management setup, which is more than zero?</strong></span>
<span style="color: rgb(216, 57, 49)">A: Creators have used your campaign links for these product(s).
