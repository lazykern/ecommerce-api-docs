## 🔥 **Product Overview**
### **Why do we support partners editing the certification details？**
Currently, the partner is required to provide certification details to join TTSPC. Once the platform has reviewed and approved certification details, these certification details cannot be changed. However, there may be instances where a partner needs to update their certification details, such as their name, logo, etc.
