## Appeal

1. If partners believe that an enforcement action has been taken against them in error, they may file an appeal within seven days of receiving the violation notice from email([tts.partner.warning@tiktok.com](mailto:tts.partner.warning@tiktok.com)). Otherwise, it will be deemed that the partners approve the enforcement. The platform will review the appeal and tell the partners the results of receiving the appeal.
2. An appeal raised by partners does not affect the validity, execution and publicity of the decision already made by the platform. Only when an appeal is successful will we remove any corrective actions issued.
3. Partners can refer to the violation notice to choose the correct appeal channel.
   (email:[tts.partner.appeal@tiktok.com](mailto:tts.partner.appeal@tiktok.com)).

1）The subject of the email must include the following:
Partner ID + Order ID + [Appeal]
2）The content of the email must include the following:
① Partner ID, Order ID (text);
② Violation ID + Violation reason;
③ Appeal reason and relevant materials, including but not limited to chat records, screenshots, links, photos, recordings, etc.
## Appendix

1. These rules will become effective on December 10, 2022.
2. The platform will sample the services provided by partners from time to time. If the partners and their services violate the rules, the platform will take enforcement actions accordingly. Meanwhile, the platform will suspend all online operational and promotional resources and give a public warning. Only when partners have corrected all the violation behaviors and the period of corrective actions ends can they resume regular operation.
3. The platform manages and takes enforcement actions against all accounts and services of partners. If the same identity authentication information is used or the actual controller of multiple accounts is determined to be the same person after investigation, they are all regarded as the same partner. If partners and their services violate the rules, the platform reserves the right to take enforcement actions of the same severity on all the accounts and services of the same partner.
4. The determination and handling of violations shall be based on the evidence of violations or the facts determined by the platform (the platform has the right to adjust the enforcement actions in light of the actual situation).
5. If more than one violation is found, the platform will penalize the more severe violation. It does not mean that the partner has only one violation.
6. If the partner violates the rules again or repeatedly, the platform may take multiple enforcement actions based on the rules the partner has violated and the number of violations.
7. Partners must abide by national laws, administrative regulations, departmental rules and other normative documents. These rules apply to any suspected violations covered. TikTok reserves the right to deal with violations not included at its discretion. However, TikTok's enforcement actions on partners do not exempt them from legal liabilities. Partners must always abide by TikTok's guidelines and their affiliates' agreements.
