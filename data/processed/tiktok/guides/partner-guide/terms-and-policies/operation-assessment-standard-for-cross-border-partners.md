| Affiliate partner | * Assessment Partners: <br>  <br> The partners who have been qualified to be TAP for over 90 days can participate in the assessment. The partners who have been qualified to be TAP for less than 90 days, including the new TAPs and the ones who have re-registered, are not able to be assessed. <br>  <br> * Assessment method: <br>  <br> On the 1st day of each month, we will assess the amount of crossborder settlement GMV and the number of creators with sales for the sales amount paid in the past 90 days. <br> During the past 90 days, if the crossborder settlement GMV is equal or over 1000$, and the number of creators with sales is equal or over 5, the TAP eligibility will be preserved. If the TAP doesn't meet this standard, the TAP will receive the dismissal notice and the system authority will be withdrawn on 15th of the month. <br>  <br> * After being dismissed by the platform due to unqualified performance assessment, there are the following tips: <br>  <br> * From the day when the authority of the TAP is revoked, you can not apply for the TAP system again within 30 days. You can apply again after 30 days. <br>  <br> * If the performance assessment fails to meet the standard TWICE, the authority of the TAP will be permanently revoked at the second time, and it will not be possible to apply for activation again. |
