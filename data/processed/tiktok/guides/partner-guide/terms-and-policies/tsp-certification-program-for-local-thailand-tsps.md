# **What is the TSP Certification Program?**
The TikTok Shop Partner (TSP) Certification Program recognizes and rewards top-performing partners who provide excellent services beyond market standards.
The program was launched for local TSPs in Thailand in Q1 2024.
Under the program, TSPs who provide fulfillment and content management services to sellers can earn points based on good performance. Awards will be given every quarter based on performance in that quarter.
There are 2 tiers of award - Premier and Certified given to TSPs who achieve at least 80 points or 50 points respectively. There will be separate awards for shop management and content management. For example, a TSP can be awarded Premier for shop management and Certified for content management.

# **FAQs**

1. **Can I participate in the certification program if I only provide content management or shop management services?**

Yes, you will still earn points under the content management or shop management categories and be eligible for the awards in that category.

2. **What happens if I make a false declaration of the shops I manage?**

You may be excluded from the program and/or forfeit any previous awards received. Shops without a valid record of an authorized relationship between seller and TSP on Partner Center will not be counted toward score computation.

3. **Is it compulsory to join the program?**

It is not compulsory, but we encourage all TSPs who are eligible to join the program.

4. **If you bind/unbind with sellers midway through the quarter, how will this be reflected in the score?**

Please update us through your AM when shops you manage change or when the category of service changes. The scoring will be based on the list of shops that you manage and bind during the period.

5. **Will appeals against violations be reflected in the score?**

We will generate the score on a monthly basis. If appeals are successful and the violation points are revoked before the generation date, they will be reflected in the score.

An aggregated report with your performance will be sent via email on a monthly basis.

7. **Is there a way to appeal the award given?**

The award given is final and at TikTok Shop’s discretion. If you have any questions or suggestions, please contact your AM for further support.

8. **If a seller collaborates with multiple agencies, how is the score calculated?**

The score will be attributed to the agency that registers the seller/handle in the form, aligning with the binding data in the system. Each agency can receive the score for one seller/handle at a time.
