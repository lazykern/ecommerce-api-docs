# **Introduction**
For U.S. L2L partners, the **Health Center > Shop Health** module on TTSPC centralizes key data for your signed sellers. No more switching to Seller Center, you can access seller health scores (AHR/SPS/CHR) and violation records directly in TTSPC. The module also highlights sellers with abnormal scores and offers flexible filters, helping you streamline governance and act proactively.
# **What Are the Benefits?** 

* **Save time on data access**: Skip logging into Seller Center. Partners now can view all critical seller health and violation data in TTSPC. 
* **Prioritize high-risk cases**: Quickly identify sellers with abnormal scores or declining health to focus on your follow-up efforts. 
* **Reduce GMV loss**: Address violations faster with clear visibility, lowering revenue impact from unhandled issues. 

# **Step by Step Guide** 
## Step 1 Get Required Authorization 
### Required Authorization 

* **Shop health/performance data**: Sellers must authorize at least one Seller Center Access role (Full Access/Customer Service/Order Fulfillment/Product Access/Ad Manager/Affiliate).
* **TikTok account health data**: Permissions follow the same scope as Seller Center Data Compass. 


### How to get authorization: 
Detailed userguide: [TSP Access Authorization Guide](https://partner.tiktokshop.com/docv2/page/666feffacf2e2202c8d39191). 
#### **For sellers**

* For new seller: When the seller authorizes TSP service through an authorization link, sellers choose Seller center access role to allow TSP access the specific authorized pages on the seller center。

* For signed seller: Signed seller can edit authorization through **Find partner >"..." > my service > Edit**

#### **For Partners** 

* In **TTSPC > seller management**, if there is no Permission role authorization / Data Compass authorization, you can click **"..." > Edit > Request permissions > Edit selection**,and then send seller request links. The seller can open the link to complete the TSP access authorization.
