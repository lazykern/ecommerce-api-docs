# What is a Developer?
Using the TikTok Shop APIs, developers build applications that offer sellers solutions to automate, manage and grow their businesses on TikTok Shop.
Via the TikTok Shop Partner Center, we provide a comprehensive set of technical tools, resources, and APIs that allow developers to integrate directly with TikTok Shop.
Our APIs span the entirety of the seller operation process, allowing developers to create integrations that can streamline merchant workflows and improve customer experiences.
