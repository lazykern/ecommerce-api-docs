# Overview
This guide covers how agencies can use Partner Campaigns to create campaigns between Sellers and Creators. With this tool, Sellers can register and submit products to an agency's campaign, and determine the commission they would like to offer to the agency. Then the agency chooses the commission they would like to set for the managed or unmanaged Creators they've selected for the campaign. Agencies share product links with the Creators so they can add the products to their showcases and promote them. The commission splitting is then completed online via the tool.
Partner Campaigns offers several benefits:

* For Agencies: A new revenue stream that allows agencies to collect commission from Sellers by setting up affiliate campaigns on their behalf.
* For Sellers: A way to outsource the creation of campaigns and selection of Creators to agencies. Sellers can apply to campaigns in the Partner Campaigns tab, described in more detail in the Seller experience section of this article.
* For Creators: More opportunities to earn affiliate commissions from product lists curated by the agencies. Participating Creators do not have to be managed by the agency.

Step 2: Enter the relevant campaign information, such as the **Target market, Basic information, Seller information**, the **Commission rate requirement**, and your **Contact information**.

* In the **Basic information** section, describe in detail what this campaign is about and make it compelling for Sellers to want to participate.
* Set the **registration period**, which defines the dates during which sellers can register products to the campaign.
* Set the **campaign period**, which defines the dates during which creators can promote the products. (**Note**: The start date for the registration period and the campaign period must be the same.)
* In the **Seller information** section, you can choose to make the campaign open to all Sellers or restrict it to selected Sellers by entering their Shop Codes.
   * You can add up to 100 Shop Codes.
   * Sellers can find Shop Codes in the Seller Center by going to My Account-> Seller Profile-> Seller Information.
* After you have filled in all the relevant details, click **Submit**.

<div style="text-align: center"><img src="https://p16-arcosite-va.ibyteimg.com/tos-maliva-i-10qhjjqwgv-us/57d64e9859634efea916420f4d6b4dc0~tplv-10qhjjqwgv-image.image" width="1328px" /></div>

<div style="text-align: center"><img src="https://p16-arcosite-va.ibyteimg.com/tos-maliva-i-10qhjjqwgv-us/5ca519faa4bc434cbfc8dc8b1170a8d1~tplv-10qhjjqwgv-image.image" width="1178px" /></div>

Step 3: After clicking **Submit**, you will be taken to the main **Campaigns** page. All of your created campaigns will be listed here. To publish the campaign to Sellers, you ++must++ turn on the **Publish Toggle**. On this page, you can also create more campaigns by clicking **Create Campaign**.
# Approving/Rejecting Seller Products
Step 1: After Sellers have registered products for your campaign, you can click into the **Campaign details** page to see all the registered products, as well as the commission rates they are offering for this campaign. Note that this is the total commission rate that will be paid to you and the Creators in the campaign.
<div style="text-align: center"><img src="https://p16-arcosite-va.ibyteimg.com/tos-maliva-i-10qhjjqwgv-us/3d4c3f095bf845cbb9c6895d87645c89~tplv-10qhjjqwgv-image.image" width="1422px" /></div>

Step 2: On the **Pending** tab, you must choose to **Approve** or **Reject** a Seller's product registration. Note that after you approve the registration, you will not be able to modify the commission rates set by the Seller. If you reject the registration, you will be asked if you would like to allow the Seller to re-register, and you will be able to give the Seller a reason for the initial rejection.
<div style="text-align: center"><img src="https://p16-arcosite-va.ibyteimg.com/tos-maliva-i-10qhjjqwgv-us/e6b06e52644a4a90baa339cdedf84b68~tplv-10qhjjqwgv-image.image" width="1458px" /></div>

![Image](https://p16-arcosite-va.ibyteimg.com/tos-maliva-i-10qhjjqwgv-us/a49f1d0fe17540aa9ca3b7a39ea0334b~tplv-10qhjjqwgv-image.image)
![Image](https://p16-arcosite-va.ibyteimg.com/tos-maliva-i-10qhjjqwgv-us/f2d7b5f3a01a4918b501b97cef9f01e2~tplv-10qhjjqwgv-image.image)
Step 3: You can navigate to the **Approved** tab (1) to see a list of approved products. Here, select products individually or in bulk (2), and then click on **Export links** (3) to generate links to share with the Creators, which will allow them to view the products in the campaign and add them to their showcase. In order to export the links, you must first set a **commission rate** (4) that you want to offer the Creators. It must be less than or equal to the campaign's total commission rate. For example, if the Seller is offering a campaign total commission rate of 30%, then the commission rate you offer to the participating Creators must be less than or equal to 30%. If you set the commission rate here as 15%, then that means Creators will receive 15% and you will receive the other 15% of the commission.
<div style="text-align: center"><img src="https://p16-arcosite-va.ibyteimg.com/tos-maliva-i-10qhjjqwgv-us/630360cda8c34723a17e905aa17c31c4~tplv-10qhjjqwgv-image.image" width="1176px" /></div>

Step 4: Rather than sending individual product links, you can also create a list of products to send to Creators by clicking on **Product lists**.
<div style="text-align: center"><img src="https://p16-arcosite-va.ibyteimg.com/tos-maliva-i-10qhjjqwgv-us/a489f7c58d71436b9f8f9febd67b1d74~tplv-10qhjjqwgv-image.image" width="1440px" /></div>

Step 5: First, give your product list a name, then select the products you want to include in the list (up to 100), and then click **Next**. Then, set the commission for each product separately, or in bulk by selecting multiple products and then clicking **Setup commission in bulk**.

![Image](https://p16-arcosite-va.ibyteimg.com/tos-maliva-i-10qhjjqwgv-us/f06444acf5be430bb26be48f85e2881d~tplv-10qhjjqwgv-image.image)
Step 6: After you've created a product list, you can view all the product lists in the **Campaign details** page. From here, copy the link to the campaign list, which you can then share with Creators. You can also edit or delete any existing lists. Note that you can only have up to 1000 lists, and each list can contain up to 100 products. If you reach the list limit, you must delete an existing list to add another one.
<div style="text-align: center"><img src="https://p16-arcosite-va.ibyteimg.com/tos-maliva-i-10qhjjqwgv-us/8515a4ad97624d12abebf61bb494349a~tplv-10qhjjqwgv-image.image" width="1440px" /></div>

Step 7: When you choose to edit a list, you can **Remove** existing products, **Add more products**, or **change the commission rates** for existing products.
<div style="text-align: center"><img src="https://p16-arcosite-va.ibyteimg.com/tos-maliva-i-10qhjjqwgv-us/379f3ea5a6dd4b4586c4ff5feec2f02a~tplv-10qhjjqwgv-image.image" width="1019px" /></div>

Step 8: Any Seller registrations you have rejected will appear in the **Rejected** tab. Here you can see whether or not you allowed the Seller to re-register the product.
<div style="text-align: center"><img src="https://p16-arcosite-va.ibyteimg.com/tos-maliva-i-10qhjjqwgv-us/cb6bdc509e704570891758fd16d31155~tplv-10qhjjqwgv-image.image" width="1564px" /></div>

Step 9: In the **Pending closed** tab you can see the Seller registrations that are about to close. Here you can **Approve** or **Reject** these registrations, as well as view the data and Creators for this registration. In the **Closed** tab, you can see the product registrations and the associated data for the ones that have already closed.

# Creator & Seller Experience
## Seller Experience
Step 1: Sellers can access agency campaigns by clicking on the **Partner Campaign** tab. From here, they can see all of the campaigns that are published in the **Campaign marketplace**. Sellers can (1) filter these campaigns by **All campaigns** or **Target campaigns** (i.e. campaigns that they were specifically invited to), (2) **Search** for specific campaigns or partners, (3) **Register** for a campaign, and (4) view their existing **My campaigns.**
<div style="text-align: center"><img src="https://p16-arcosite-va.ibyteimg.com/tos-maliva-i-10qhjjqwgv-us/c4408f10958448eda3c4922bbbe9d5e6~tplv-10qhjjqwgv-image.image" width="3240px" /></div>

Step 2: In the **My campaigns** tab, Sellers can click into a campaign to view more details, data, and re-register to a campaign.
<div style="text-align: center"><img src="https://p16-arcosite-va.ibyteimg.com/tos-maliva-i-10qhjjqwgv-us/e96b74a42d174db4b12f6b870ebe0937~tplv-10qhjjqwgv-image.image" width="1588px" /></div>

Step 3: After clicking into a specific campaign, a Seller can view more details about the campaign and the agency organizing it. Here, the Seller can also register their products by clicking **Register products** and then adding them.
![Image](https://p16-arcosite-va.ibyteimg.com/tos-maliva-i-10qhjjqwgv-us/d776a702a7074030ae44b6fd2fe2b4ac~tplv-10qhjjqwgv-image.image)
![Image](https://p16-arcosite-va.ibyteimg.com/tos-maliva-i-10qhjjqwgv-us/5689d63f0d3b480bb5c3cc3651068de4~tplv-10qhjjqwgv-image.image)
Step 4: Once a Seller has registered a product, it will be listed as pending on the campaign until the agency has approved it.
<div style="text-align: center"><img src="https://p16-arcosite-va.ibyteimg.com/tos-maliva-i-10qhjjqwgv-us/ffeed891e02040949e6e48fed3be94ce~tplv-10qhjjqwgv-image.image" width="1920px" /></div>

Step 5: After a product has been approved by the agency, it will appear in the Ongoing tab. Here, the Seller can choose to cancel a specific product collaboration by clicking **Close**. The agency must then approve the cancellation request before it takes effect.
<div style="text-align: center"><img src="https://p16-arcosite-va.ibyteimg.com/tos-maliva-i-10qhjjqwgv-us/f1e9b7b1f9174fc2a1634a3ccfbf04c6~tplv-10qhjjqwgv-image.image" width="1037px" /></div>

Step 6: In the **Rejected** tab, a Seller can view all the collaborations that have not been approved by the agency. There are two possible scenarios here. In the first scenario (1), the agency has rejected the registration, but has provided a reason why and has given the Seller the opportunity to **Re-register**. In the second scenario (2), the agency has rejected the Seller's product registration and blocked the Seller from registering the product again.
<div style="text-align: center"><img src="https://p16-arcosite-va.ibyteimg.com/tos-maliva-i-10qhjjqwgv-us/2ebfbfdd24f34089b1817b1bce8697d3~tplv-10qhjjqwgv-image.image" width="1037px" /></div>

Step 7: In the **Closed** tab, Sellers can **View Data** for product campaigns that have already closed.
<div style="text-align: center"><img src="https://p16-arcosite-va.ibyteimg.com/tos-maliva-i-10qhjjqwgv-us/c3f36ea9de554919b03e7cbaf04f7c50~tplv-10qhjjqwgv-image.image" width="1037px" /></div>

Step 8: In the **Performance** tab, Sellers can view the data for this specific campaign, including the registered products, the number of orders, and the commission totals. From here, Sellers can also **Export** the existing orders.

## Creator Experience
Step 1: Once the agency provides a link to the Creator, the Creator can paste that link by going to TikTok Shop, and clicking on **Add product**, then the **link icon** on the top right of the page, and pasting the link into **Product URL**.
![Image](https://p16-arcosite-va.ibyteimg.com/tos-maliva-i-10qhjjqwgv-us/1cf0f9448817458886307419bd0ee77c~tplv-10qhjjqwgv-image.image)
![Image](https://p16-arcosite-va.ibyteimg.com/tos-maliva-i-10qhjjqwgv-us/054a88f1f6954455a82b35c1072e4008~tplv-10qhjjqwgv-image.image)
![Image](https://p16-arcosite-va.ibyteimg.com/tos-maliva-i-10qhjjqwgv-us/e0ed7cf3e8c04752a8bf22ee41e89fd0~tplv-10qhjjqwgv-image.image)
Step 2: Once the Creator has entered the product link, the Creator will be prompted to **Add to showcase** and **Agree to the terms** and conditions of participating in the affiliate campaign.
<div style="text-align: center"><img src="https://p16-arcosite-va.ibyteimg.com/tos-maliva-i-10qhjjqwgv-us/4b92e9a0c84f4c498f836923f911bfc6~tplv-10qhjjqwgv-image.image" width="922px" /></div>

Step 3: If the Creator receives a list link, then they will be shown a list of products in the campaign after accepting the terms and conditions. The Creator can **Add all to showcase** or add them individually. When a Creator clicks into a product details page, they can see the commission rate and **Add to showcase**. The commission rate that is shown to the Creator is the commission rate they are paid by the agency, not the Seller.

![Image](https://p16-arcosite-va.ibyteimg.com/tos-maliva-i-10qhjjqwgv-us/afd6d46d1e2545ef92be7126f36a326d~tplv-10qhjjqwgv-image.image)
![Image](https://p16-arcosite-va.ibyteimg.com/tos-maliva-i-10qhjjqwgv-us/098e6ace4da14b21b10dde962b92ce37~tplv-10qhjjqwgv-image.image)

Step 4: In cases when the commission rate in this campaign is lower than the commission rate the Creator is already receiving for a product or list, the Creator will receive alerts that their commission will decrease if they add the products from this campaign.
![Image](https://p16-arcosite-va.ibyteimg.com/tos-maliva-i-10qhjjqwgv-us/05dd7ab8f6ef459c9d2cc183d83d6778~tplv-10qhjjqwgv-image.image)

Step 5: If after entering a link, a Creator receives a **No available products yet** or **The product list wasn't found** message, it means that the campaign does not have any products in it yet or that the agency has deleted the product or list.
![Image](https://p16-arcosite-va.ibyteimg.com/tos-maliva-i-10qhjjqwgv-us/07f07ae2d1a248418f3d93e041344ebc~tplv-10qhjjqwgv-image.image)

Step 6: In the **Affiliate orders** page, Creators will be shown when a sale and commission is from an agency-led campaign.

# FAQ

1. What happens if the agency that created the Partner Campaign is also linked to one of the Creators participating in the campaign?

The agency can only collect commission from the Seller. The agency cannot collect commission from the Creator, as this would be considered "double dipping."

2. What happens if the agency that created the Partner Campaign invites a Creator to the campaign who is managed by another agency?

The agency that created the campaign will still receive a commission from the Seller and can decide how much of that commission to give to the Creator. The remaining commission that goes to the Creator is then split between the Creator and the agency that manages the Creator, based on the existing agreement between both parties.

3. Can sellers see creator-specific performance data?

No, sellers cannot see creator-specific performance data. Sellers are only able to view product-specific performance data. Partner Campaigns are therefore recommended for sellers who are eager to outsource their work to agencies, but do not require detailed insights into creator-specific sales performance.
