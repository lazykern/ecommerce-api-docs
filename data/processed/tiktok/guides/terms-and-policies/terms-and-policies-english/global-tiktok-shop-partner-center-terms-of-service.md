For the avoidance of doubt, in relation to Your Partner Services in Singapore, You agree and acknowledge that PIPO HK and PIPO PH do not provide nor offer to provide You any Payment Services, and we do not offer You any services provided by PIPO HK or PIPO PH, whether on PIPO HK’s or PIPO PH's behalf or otherwise.
The Affiliate Partner Payment Service Agreement will stipulate the terms and conditions of the Payment Services that Third Party PSP may agree to provide to You. By agreeing to these Terms, You agree to be bound by the Affiliate Partner Payment Service Agreement with the Third Party PSP. If You do not enter into the Affiliate Partner Payment Service Agreement with Third Party PSP, TikTok will not be able to provide the “Campaign” feature to You, because TikTok will not be in a position to provide any Payment Services to You, which means that You will not receive commission from sellers or instruct the Third Party PSP to pay commission to creators pursuant to the arrangement between seller and You or between creators and You.
For the avoidance of doubt, You acknowledge and agree that while TikTok may provide instructions on Your behalf to Third Party PSP to facilitate or support the Payment Services that Third Party PSP provides to You, any Payment Services that Third Party PSP provides to You will be provided by Third Party PSP in its own capacity (including through its other affiliates or partners), and TikTok is not acting as an agent or delegate of Third Party PSP with respect to such Payment Services. TikTok will not be liable to You for any losses suffered as a result of any breach or default by Third Party PSP under the Affiliate Partner Payment Service Agreement, or any other agreement that You enter into with Third Party PSP with respect to the Payment Services or otherwise.
You acknowledge and agree that Your payment of the “commission fee” through the TTSPC for any services a Subscriber provides to You through the “Campaign” feature is pursuant to the agreement reached between Subscribers and You on the TikTok Platform, and TikTok will not be responsible for any other arrangements between Subscribers and You outside the TikTok Platform.
## A2: Payment Services
You acknowledge that as the TTSPC provider, TikTok will have information on transactions (including the procurement and provision of services between creators and sellers, the “commission fee” arrangements between creators and You, and the “management fee” arrangements between creators and You). As such, it will be more efficient and expedient for TikTok to provide instructions to Third Party PSP on your behalf, to facilitate and support the Payment Services that the Third Party PSP provides to You.
In this regard, You acknowledge and agree for TikTok to provide information and instructions to the Third Party PSP on Your behalf, so that the Third Party PSP may carry out the Payment Services for You. Without limitation, You authorize TikTok to notify the Third Party PSP of the following events:
-  amount of the “commission fee” that are due to creators pursuant to the arrangement between You and the creator;
-  amount of commission which is to be collected by You on behalf of the creators as agreed between You and the creator;
any other matter in connection with Your arrangements with Subscribers, including without limitation any dispute or settlement between You and Subscribers and any order, ruling, award or judgment from a competent court, arbitration tribunal or authority which directs the release of monies.

a. Agreement to Binding Individual Arbitration Between You and TikTok
You and TikTok, including third-party beneficiaries, agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the existence, breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof will be resolved by binding arbitration, and not in a court of law.
Such arbitration will be conducted only on an individual basis, and You and TikTok are each waiving the right to resolution of disputes in a court of law by a judge or jury or to participate as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class, collective, or consolidated action (and, to the fullest extent permitted by law, representative proceeding) (“**Class Action Waiver**”).

c. Governing Law and Rules
The parties agree and acknowledge that this Arbitration Agreement evidences a transaction involving interstate commerce and that the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1 et seq.

The Arbitrator will be either (1) a single retired judge or (2) a single attorney licensed in the state of California, selected by the parties (or appointed by AAA if the parties cannot agree) from the AAA’s roster of commercial dispute arbitrators.  Unless the parties otherwise agree or the Arbitrator otherwise requires, the arbitration will be conducted in Los Angeles County, California, and claims that do not exceed $10,000 will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted by the parties.  The Arbitrator will issue a reasoned, final, and binding decision, and judgment on the Arbitrator’s award may be entered in any court having appropriate jurisdiction.
e. Severability
If any portion of this Arbitration Agreement is found to be unenforceable or unlawful for any reason, (i) the unenforceable or unlawful provision will be severed from this Arbitration Agreement, (ii) the remainder of the Arbitration Agreement will be given full force and effect, and (iii) severance of the unenforceable or unlawful provision will have no impact on the remainder of the Arbitration Agreement or the parties’ ability to compel arbitration of any remaining claims on an individual basis; provided that severance will not result in severing the Class Action Waiver in section D3(a) in any manner that permits mass arbitration, to which the parties expressly do not consent.

## 5. **Táillí**

Ní bheidh TikTok faoi dhliteanas duit as aon chaillteanais a fulaingíodh mar thoradh ar aon sárú nó mainneachtain ag PSP Tríú Páirtí faoin gComhaontú Seirbhíse Íocaíochta Comhpháirtí, nó aon chomhaontú eile a dhéanann Tú le PSP Tríú Páirtí maidir leis na Seirbhísí Íocaíochta nó eile. 
Aithníonn tú agus aontaíonn tú go bhfuil d’íocaíocht den “táille choimisiúin” tríd an TTSPC as aon seirbhísí a sholáthraíonn Suibscríobhaí duit tríd an ngné “Feachtas” de bhun an chomhaontaithe ar thángthas air idir na Sínitheoirí agus Tusa ar Ardán TikTok, agus ní bheidh TikTok freagrach as aon socruithe eile idir Suibscríobhaithe agus Tusa lasmuigh den Ardán TikTok.

Mar sin, beidh sé níos éifeachtaí agus níos fóirsteanaí do TikTok treoracha a sholáthar do PSP Tríú Páirtí thar do cheann, chun na Seirbhísí Íocaíochta a sholáthraíonn an PSP Tríú Páirtí duit a éascú agus tacú leo. 
Maidir leis seo, admhaíonn Tú agus aontaíonn tú go gcuirfidh TikTok faisnéis agus treoracha ar fáil don PSP Tríú Páirtí ar Do shon, ionas gur féidir leis an PSP Tríú Páirtí na Seirbhísí Íocaíochta a chur i gcrích Duitse.

aon ábhar eile a bhaineann le Do shocruithe le Síntiúsóirí, lena n-áirítear gan teorainn aon díospóid nó réiteach idir Tú féin agus Síntiúsóirí agus aon ordú, rialú, dámhachtain nó breithiúnas ó chúirt inniúil, binse eadrána nó údarás a ordaíonn airgead a scaoileadh.

## B4. Líonra Il-Chainéil
Má ghníomhaíonn Tú mar líonra ilchainéil ar TTSPC, féadfaidh Tú cuirí a sheoladh chuig an cruthaitheoir chun gníomhú mar ghníomhaire dó ar feadh na híostréimhse éifeachtach a luaitear sa chuireadh mura bhfuil Tú féin agus an cruthaitheoir tar éis comhaontú le foirceannadh níos luaithe.
