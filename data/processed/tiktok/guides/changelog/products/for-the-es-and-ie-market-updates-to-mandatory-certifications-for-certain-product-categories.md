## Summary
As of **9 December, 2024** all local sellers in the EU market will need to ensure all the relevant information around food labeling. Developers will need to require merchants to provide product marking and labeling certificates so that they can be displayed on the product detail page as per regulations. After December 9th, failure to provide these certifications will result in product listing failures.
## API Changes
The relevant APIs for this change are *Create Product*, *Edit Product*, *Partial Edit Product*, and *Get Category Rule*.
For the ES and IE market, TikTok Shop is implementing new Mandatory Certifications for certain product categories. Starting from 2024-12-09, Products API will be updated to require Mandatory Certifications.
Without mandatory product certifications for products within specific categories, sellers will not be able to create and update products.
Most product categories will require labeling as the new mandatory certification. Use the Get Category Rule to check what product certifications are required and pass the product certification files via the Create Product, Edit Product, and Partial Edit Product to help sellers submit product certification.
