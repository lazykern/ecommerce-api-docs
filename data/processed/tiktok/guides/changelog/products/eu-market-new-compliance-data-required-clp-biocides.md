# Next steps
To avoid errors when creating products, you **must** update required category fields in your app to surface the new attributes per category rules.
**General recommendation**: Product categories are updated frequently, so it's recommended to call the API in real time to ensure you are using the latest category data. Caching category data locally may result in using outdated information, leading to errors when creating products.
