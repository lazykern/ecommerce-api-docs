Since TikTok Shop is proposing to allow buyers to cancel eligible orders between the status Ready To Ship (RTS) and Transit To Ship (TTS), please configure the "[Cancellation status change](https://partner.tiktokshop.com/docv2/page/11-cancellation-status-change)" webhook to receive cancellation messages. If sellers receive such a cancellation message, they need to takeout the parcel and do not ship it.
