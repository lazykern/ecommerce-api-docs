# Development Shop Introduction
Seller Center Development Shops offer developers the ability to easily and efficiently generate Test Seller Center accounts that can be used for testing and development of TikTok Shop APIs. These test accounts will replicate production Seller Center Accounts and provide access to all production features and functionalities. Seller Center Development Shops are created exclusively for each Partner Center account. The key difference between Seller Center Development Shops and Product TikTok Shop Seller Center accounts is that Development Shops can not be discovered by TikTok users in the regular TikTok Apps.
## Examples of actions in Seller Development Shops

# Supported markets and seller types
Seller Development Shops are now available for the US and UK markets.
