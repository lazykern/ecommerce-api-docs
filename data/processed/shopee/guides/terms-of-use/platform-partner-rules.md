# 2\. Data security

 

To ensure that important data belonging to sellers and the Shopee platform are protected against misuse or leaks, all developers using Shopee Open Platform are required to abide strictly by our [_Data Protection Policy_](<https://open.shopee.com/policy?policy_id=1>). 

 

You are required to accept and agree to the terms of the Data Protection Policy before you can access the Shopee Open Platform.

  1. Illegal data use, such as misuse, sharing, or leaking of user information, intentionally or unintentionally.
  2. Unlawful collection of user data, including the uses set out in the Data Protection Policy.
  3. Sharing or leaking of your APP’s sensitive information, which results in user information leakage.
  4. Concealing and exploiting flaws or vulnerabilities present on Shopee Open Platform.
  5. Concealing or failing to report server assets on time and shielding your platform(s) from regular inspections from Shopee Open Platform.

  8. All brushing activities, including but not limited to creating fake orders, reviews, followers, and likes.
  9. Any other unfair competition business practices.



 

**💡 Tips**

 

To avoid being flagged for illegal or inappropriate behavior, you should always keep to honest selling practices.

# 4\. Accuracy of shared information

 

Transparency is key to a good working relationship and it is expected of all Open Platform developers who are given access to the Shopee Open Platform. 

 

Any Open Platform developer that is found to intentionally hide business information will be penalized. This includes, but is not limited to, providing inaccurate details, and offering services that are different from submitted descriptions.

 

You are required to accept and agree to the [_Terms of Service_](<https://open.shopee.com/agreement>) before you can access the Shopee Open Platform.

 

**💡 Tips**

 

To avoid sharing inaccurate information, check your Open Platform application carefully. 

 

You should also edit your APP details on the [_Open Platform Console App Management page_](<https://open.shopee.com/myconsole/management/app>) whenever there are changes to (i) the services you provide (ii) your IT assets or (iii) your IT infrastructure.

# 5\. API Performance and Activity

 

Having good API Performance and Activity ensures that our developers provide high quality service to Shopee users. Open Platform developers should also regularly monitor their API call success rates and make the necessary changes in a timely manner, as may be requested by Shopee from time to time.

 

All developers are expected to meet the following requirements: 

  1. Your Application should go live and be made available to users within 90 consecutive days after its creation date.
  2. Your Application should make at least 1 API call within a duration of 90 consecutive days after its live date.
  3. Your Application should have a sufficiently high API call success rate, and should not fall below a daily average of 90%.



 

Shopee reserves the right to penalize Open Platform developers that do not meet the above criteria or do not provide a satisfactory response when informed of the violations above.

 

**💡 Tips**

 

If your Application’s API success rate is deemed to be consistently low, Shopee will reach out via your registered email. To stay informed, ensure that your email address(es) are in use. If your registered email is no longer in use, please update your email address by sending a request to _openapi@support.shopee.com_. 

# 6\. Third-party Platform Fulfillment Policy

 

The Third-party Platform Fulfillment Policy applies to all Third-party Partner Platforms that help sellers ship their orders from another retailer or your warehouse directly to the buyers. 

 

The policy is in place to ensure that Third-party Partner Platforms which provide fulfillment services can help sellers fulfill orders on time and in good condition.

 

Shopee takes a serious stance against Third-party Partner Platforms which commit the following violations:

**💡 Tips**

 

Learn about[ _improving your NFR and LSR_](<https://seller.shopee.sg/edu/article/756>) or share best practices with your retailer partners to avoid fulfillment penalties.
