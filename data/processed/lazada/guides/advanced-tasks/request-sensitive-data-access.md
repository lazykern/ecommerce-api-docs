Lazada Open Platform provides a security framework to protect the sensitive business data of sellers. By default, these business data are masked according to security evaluation. Sensitive business data include:

  * Product information, such as price, stock, and promotion details.
  * Order and order item details
  * Customer name and contact information
  * Financial and transaction statements

  


To request access to the sensitive business data, you need to go through a review process for your application on Lazada DataMoat, a security module that is integrated with Lazada Open Platform. 

Take the following steps to request sensitive data access:  
1\. From the list of your applications, click **Manage** to open the overview page of your application.  
2\. On the **App Overview** page, you can find the **Sensitive Data Privilege** field under the **Advanced Information** section.  
3\. Click **Apply Unmask**. The **Access to Sensitive Data** page on Lazada Datamoat is opened.  
4\. Follow the instructions on the **Access to Sensitive Data** page to obtain access to sensitive data for your application. You can also refer to the [DataMoat documentation](<https://open.lazada.com/apps/doc/doc?nodeId=30420&docId=120738>) for details.
