**2\. API Monitoring**

ISV must regularly monitor the API call success rates and make necessary improvement in a timely manner as may be notified by Lazada from time to time.

Lazada reserves the right to take the penalty measures prescribed in Section 4 below if the API call success rate by an Application is deemed to be consistently low, or the response of the ISV is deemed or unsatisfactory by Lazada.

**3.****Vulnerabilities and Security Testing**

3.1. Lazada may test your Application from time to time using either manual security testing methods or automated security testing methods in accordance with Clause 5.3 and Schedule 1 of the Developers’ Agreement. 

3.2. Lazada may notify you of any Vulnerabilities identified by Lazada, and require you to undertake remedial actions to rectify or mitigate the Vulnerabilities within the following timeline (or such other timeline determined by Lazada), depending on the risk rating for such Vulnerability, which shall be determined by Lazada at its sole discretion:

Risk Rating | Description | No. of Days from Notification to Complete Remedial Actions
---|---|---
Critical | Critical risk or vulnerabilities that place Lazada Content at immediate risk of Data Breaches | Max. 14 days
High | Severe risk that should be addressed immediately to protect Lazada Content | Max. 30 days
Medium | Unnecessary security risks that can lead to more serious vulnerabilities | Max. 60 days
Low | Areas of improvement to reduce risk | Max. 90 days

 

3.3. Upon such notification, you shall promptly propose to Lazada in writing the remedial actions to rectify or mitigate the vulnerabilities in a manner which is reasonably satisfactory to Lazada. Upon Lazada’s approval (which may be withheld in Lazada’s sole and absolute discretion), you shall complete such rectification or mitigation at your own cost and expense within the relevant timeline as set out in in these Platform Rules or such other timeline as may be determined by Lazada at its sole discretion.

3.4. Without prejudice to any other rights or remedies that the Lazada Group may have under the Developer Agreement and the Terms of Use, Lazada may take one or more of the measures as set out in the Section 4 below against the Developer or the Application if it becomes aware or reasonably suspects that the Developer is unable to remedy or fix such Vulnerabilities or is otherwise in breach of the data protection requirements.

3.5. Lazada reserves the right to suspend or terminate the Developer’s access to Personal Data immediately if Lazada becomes aware or reasonably suspects that a Data Breach has been suffered by the Developer without liability to the Developer.
