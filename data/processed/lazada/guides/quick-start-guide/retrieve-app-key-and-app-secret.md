App Key is the unique identity of an application on Lazada Open Platform. The App Key is one of the parameters that must be included in the request of API calls, and the application will be identified with the App Key by Lazada Open Platform.

App Secret is the key that is assigned to an application by Lazada Open Platform, which ensures the security and reliability of the application source. You must keep the App Secret properly and should not share it with any third party.

4\. Click **Reset** to reset the App Secret of your application. For the **Old Secret Expires In** field, select the time (in hours) for the old App Secret to expire.
