A reverse order is an order that is generated when a refund or return request is initiated by the buyer after the order is updated to "Delivered". Reverse orders are not generated if the order is cancelled before shipping or if the status is updated to "Failed Delivery".

# When a buyer can initiate a return

The buyer can initiate the order within the time limit after receiving the order or before updating the order to "Confirm" status (which is not common to all countries).

# Return order type

Returns will be made by two different types of reverse orders:

**RTM type** ：Full name Return to Merchant,This type will have the seller manually review within the SLA whether the return is uniform and check the goods and operate on their own whether to refund.

**RTW type** ：Full name Return to Lazada Warehouse,This type is only available to some sellers and will be handled by Lazada for returns, without the seller having to do it manually.

# Return Type

**Return** ：The buyer needs to send the goods back to the seller.

**Only Refund：** Buyers do not need to send back the goods can be directly refunded (only a few categories have this option such as fresh categories, etc.).
