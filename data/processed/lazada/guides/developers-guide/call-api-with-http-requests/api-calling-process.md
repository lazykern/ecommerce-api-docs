Lazada Open Platform APIs are called through HTTP requests. You can call the API by using the platform provided SDK (recommended), or by assembling the request with a certain format according to the Lazada Open Platform protocols (only if no official SDK is provided for a programming language). This section introduces how to assemble HTTP requests to call the Lazada APIs.

API calls require data for input and return output as the responses. The general steps for calling an API through generating HTTP requests are as follows:  
1\. Populate parameters and values  
2\. Generate signature  
3\. Assemble HTTP requests  
4\. Initiate HTTP requests  
5\. Get HTTP responses  
6\. Interpret JSON/XML responses

Refer to the sections below for detailed information about the API calling process on Lazada Open Platform.
