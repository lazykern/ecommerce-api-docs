Availability Control**\nDeveloper shall take technical and organizational measures in order to protect the data from accidental destruction or loss, including, at a minimum:\n(a) Appliances for the monitoring of temperature and humidity in data centers;\n(b) Fire/smoke detectors and fire extinguishers or fire suppression systems in data centers;\n(c) Use of mature and appropriate anti-virus software that includes e-mail filtering and malware detection;\n(d) Data recovery measures and emergency plan in place and regularly tested;\n(e) Implementation of mature and appropriate backup methods including physical separation of the backup data and storage of data stored in a redundant archive;\n(f) Use a combination of full, differential, and cumulative backups to ensure data integrity and timely restoration for core data, as appropriate;\n(g) To ensure an uninterrupted supply of power to the system, redundant power supply units are built into the systems wherever possible;\n(h) Integrity of stored data regularly verified using checksums;\n(i) Processes in place to move data traffic away from affected areas to uncompromised areas in case of failure;\n(j) Preventative maintenance is performed to ensure continued operability of equipment; and\n(k) Appropriate Denial of Service and Distributed Denial of Service technology in place to defend against network and systems-based resource starvation attacks.\n**VIII. Minimum Security Standards**\nYou must document, implement and maintain an information security program that meets the standards of best industry practice, which will include:\n(a) Information Security Policies\n(i) Approved security policies aligned to industry standard-ISO27001 or NIST 800-53\n(ii) Industry standard certification such as ISO27001 or SOC2\n(iii) (At a minimum) annual review of information security policies\n(iv) High level conceptual data flow diagram\n(b) Organization of Information Security\n(i) Dedicated information security function responsible for security initiatives and operations\n(ii) High level description of roles and responsibilities within the security organization\n(iii) Dedicated information security risk management function\n(c) Human Resource Security\n(i) Signed non-disclosure agreements by all personnel handling confidential data\n(ii) Annual security awareness, education and training\n(iii) Background checks for corporate users\n(iv) Background checks for contractors\n(v) Disciplinary process for policy violations\n(vi) Documented management responsibilities for security\n(vii) Termination or change of employment controls\n(viii) Dedicated HR governance and technology systems\n(d) Asset Management\n(i) Management oversight of assets and data\n(ii) Assigned ownership for all assets\n(iii) Classification and handling of assets\n(iv) Process for management and disposal of removable media\n(e) Access Control\n(i) Least privilege, segregation of duty and need to know basis security concepts are embedded into the access management process\n(ii) Access assurance control program\n(iii) Periodic access review (at least annually)\n(iv) Access termination within 24-48 hours for separated users\n(v) Management of privileged access rights\n(vi) Use of multi-factor authentication (MFA) and/or single sign-on (SSO)\n(vii) SAML 2.0 or SCIM integration readily available to TikTok\n(viii) Password complexity/configuration requirements in accordance with TikTok standards\n(ix) Password management system with applicable security controls (where applicable)\n",
