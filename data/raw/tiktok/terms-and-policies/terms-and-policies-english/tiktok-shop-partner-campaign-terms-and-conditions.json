Please read and make sure you understand these guidelines before doing so. \nIf you are a Partner, Seller, Creator or any other party involved in content creation, you should note that these guidelines are not an exhaustive list of your obligations and do not override those obligations imposed on you by law or under the terms and conditions that apply to your use of TikTok Shop. You are fully responsible for ensuring that your content complies with applicable laws and regulations, and the [TikTok Community Guidelines](https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines/en?lang=en). Please note, these guidelines do not constitute legal advice, and you must consult a lawyer if you have any questions about the rules relating to content creation for the TikTok Shop.\nCommercial content should always be labelled appropriately with a clear primary advertisement label (i.e. #ad; platform provided label (e.g. ‘paid partnership’; or #gifted)) and use of a secondary label as appropriate (e.g. #collaboration; #BrandAmbassador; #Sponsored) or that may be required by applicable law or any applicable governing body or regulator (and you shall ensure that you use the Content Disclosure Settings provided by TikTok and comply with the [TikTok Shop EU Content Guidelines for Sellers and Creators](https://seller-ie.tiktok.com/university/essay?knowledge_id=8154736403449633&identity=1)). Labels should be clearly positioned using appropriate colour that stands out from the background – (i) for posts, the label should be the first word of the text; and (ii) for videos, clear visual advertising label at the start of the video and tell the audience.\n\n## **1. Take care not to mislead your audience** \n\nWhen promoting something to your audience, it is important that you provide them with all the information they need to make an informed decision before purchase, that you do not provide any false or misleading information, and that you do not mislead by omitting information or presenting information in an unclear or ambiguous manner. \n\n***Price and availability***\n \n**✅ Do** make sure that when stating the price of a product you make clear the whole price of purchasing that product (including any delivery charges and taxes), not just the price of the item itself.\n**✅ Do** make sure that you make it clear to your audience that stock is limited (where applicable), to avoid disappointment. \n**✅ Do** make clear any restrictions on the availability of the products, including any geographical restrictions or age limits.\n \n**❎ Don’t** advertise one product and switch it for a different type of product when sending it to the customer. You must advertise the same type of product to your audience, so they know what they are purchasing. \n**❎ Don’t** falsely state that a product will only be available for a very limited time or that stock is limited where this is not the case in order to pressure the customer into making an immediate decision. \n\n***Claims and factual statements***\n ****** \n**✅ Do** make sure you have evidence to prove any claims that your audience are likely to regard as factually true.\n**✅ Do** take care when making any environmental claims about the advertised product. If you want to make an environmental-related claim about the product, you must ensure that the basis of the claim is clear, and what part of the advertised product it relates to and include all appropriate qualifications. The meaning of all terms must be clear to your audience (such as “recycled”, “green” or “sustainable”).\n**✅ Do** make sure any environmental claims about the advertised products are supported by evidence, and make sure you keep a record of this (unqualified environmental claims should not be made unless they can be substantiated by showing that the product will cause no environmental damage). Please speak to a lawyer if you are not sure how to properly back up your claim. \n \n**❎ Don’t** compare one product with another (by price, attribute or otherwise). \n**❎ Don’t** claim that you are acting as a consumer, as opposed to in the course of your business or trade.\n**❎ Don’t** present rights that the consumer has under the law as a special right / benefit that you have granted them (e.g. a right to a return after 14 days).\n**❎ Don’t** over-exaggerate. Naturally, you want to portray the advertised product in the best light, but you must make sure that your audience is not led to believe the capability or performance of the product is better than it actually is. You must be able to substantiate with documentary evidence, all claims which a consumer may believe to be objectively true.\n**❎ Don’t** display a trust or quality mark without first gaining appropriate permission.\n**❎ Don’t** include or imply third party endorsements or testimonials in your content, unless you have evidence of the endorsement, and permission from the third party to share it. \n**❎ Don’t** claim that the product can cure illnesses or has any health benefits where this is not the case. \n**❎ Don't** promote any medicinal products and medical treatments that are available only on prescription.\n**❎ Don’t** use the phrase “guarantee”. This is a legally sensitive term and could confuse your audience about their rights in connection with the advertised product.\n**❎ Don't** use or display any products for any purpose for which the product has not been designed. \n **** \n## **2. Don’t cause harm or offence**\n\nDon’t include anything in the content that you create that is likely to cause serious or widespread offence or that could be deemed to damage the reputation of anyone.\n \n**❎ Don’t** include any content that is discriminatory or promotes discrimination in any way (including on the basis of sex, racial or ethnic origin, nationality, religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation, marital status, family status or Membership of the Traveller Community) or is likely to harass, defame or threaten another person. \n**❎ Don't** include any content that is unlawful or fraudulent or has any unlawful or fraudulent purpose or effect. \n**❎ Don't** include any content that includes alcohol, smoking or gambling or any other age restricted products or activities.\n**❎ Don't** include any content that infringes a third party's rights, including rights to intellectual property, image rights, confidentiality or privacy, or is likely to deceive any person.\n**❎ Don't** promote any sexually explicit material or violence or encourage any person to do a harmful or criminal act. \n**❎ Don't** impersonate another person or misrepresent your identity or affiliation with any person. \n**❎ Don’t** swear. \n**❎ Don’t** encourage behaviour that is violent, socially irresponsible or prejudicial to health and safety or the protection of the environment.\n**❎ Don’t** include any content that could damage the reputation of any company, brand or individual. \n**❎ Don’t** portray or represent anyone who is, or seems to be, under 18 in a sexual way or show them in any type of dangerous situation. \n**❎ Don't** show **** any unsafe use of products or use products in a dangerous way.  **** \n\n## **3. Tailor to your audience** \n \nWhen creating content, be aware of who the audience is, and whether there are any sensitivities to keep in mind. Think about the context in which your content is made, the product you are promoting, the age and background of your audience, and relevant standards and attitudes. Remember that certain members of your audience may be more vulnerable than others, and therefore more impacted by your marketing content.\n \n**❎ Don’t** include visual effects or techniques that are likely to adversely affect members of the public with photosensitive epilepsy.\n**❎ Don’t** directly target under 18s to encourage them to buy the advertised product.\n**❎ Don’t** try and encourage under 18s to persuade their parents or guardians to buy anything on their behalf.\n\n## **4. Only offer genuine discounts**\n **** \nYou should take particular care when comparing a discounted price of a product to another price (a “reference price”) for the same product. \n \n**✅ Do** ensure that reference prices are genuine and verifiable. \n**✅ Do** make sure that the reference price is the lowest price the product was offered via the TikTok Shop by the specific trader the previous 30 days, and is included in all promotional statements about a price reduction of that specific product. \n \n**❎ Don’t** use reference prices that are older than the lowest price the product was advertised at on the TikTok Shop in the previous 30 days before the discount was applied. \n**❎ Don’t** artificially increase prices for a short period of time to facilitate the advertising of a discount. If you increase a price, you can’t use that increased price as the reference price for any discounting until the product has been sold at that increased price for at least 30 days. \n**❎ Don’t** offer a discounted price that is not lower than the reference price. \n\n## **5. Organising promotions carefully**\n \nIf you are organising a promotion to advertise a product, such as by offering a discount or running a competition or prize draw, it is important that you administer the promotion carefully.  \n \n**✅ Do** conduct your promotion equitably, fairly, and efficiently. For competitions / draws, make sure you keep a record of how the promotion will be administered, and how the winner will be selected. \n**✅ Do** make sure you estimate the likely response from your audience, and keep a record of this, to ensure that you can meet availability and your audience are aware of the opportunity to win.\n**✅ Do** make all the important information available, setting out how to participate, the start date and closing date, any free-to-enter routes available, the number and nature of prizes, any restrictions (geographical, technical, or otherwise), availability of prizes, and how and when winners will be notified of results. This includes any geographical, age, eligibility restrictions, any requirements on proof of purchase, any permissions required (e.g. parental), any limit on the number of prizes, whether a cash alternative can be substituted for the prize.\n**✅ Do** make sure your promotion is conducted under proper supervision with adequate resources in place to administer it. \n**✅ Do** ensure that any competition or prize draw complies with all applicable gambling and related regulatory requirements and seek specific legal advice where necessary.  ****  \n**✅ Do,** if the selection of the winner is subject to subjective interpretation, appoint an independent judge, or a panel to judge the subject matter of the competition (or an independent observer in the case of prize draws).\n \n**❎ Don’t** claim that any product is ‘free’, ‘without charge’ or similar if the consumer has to pay anything other than a delivery charge.\n\n## **6. Music and third-party rights** \n \nYou must ensure that you only include music and other third-party creative content which you have the rights to.\n \n**✅ Do** include music from the Commercial Music Library, if you wish to include music in your content.\n \n**❎ Don’t** include music which is not available in the Commercial Music Library unless you have obtained the necessary music licensing rights to use it and provided TikTok with evidence of this. \n**❎ Don’t** refer to third party names or include third party logos in your content unless you have the permission of the third party to do so.\n\n\n---\n\n\n\n\n<div style=\"text-align: center\"><h1 id=\"2d1ca1fb\"><strong>TikTok Shop - Téarmaí agus Coinníollacha Feachtais Comhpháirtithe</strong></h1></div>\n\n\nNuashonrú is déanaí: 24 Feabhra 2025\nIs mian le TikTok Technology Limited, cuideachta atá cláraithe i bPoblacht na hÉireann leis an uimhir chuideachta 635755 agus a bhfuil a oifig chláraithe aici ag The Sorting Office, Ropemaker Place, Dublin 2, Dublin, D02 HD23 (“**TikTok**”) TAP, CAP nó TSP tú a fhostú, mar atá sainmhínithe thíos (\"**Comhpháirtí**\", \"**Tú**\", nó “**Do**”) chun Do sheirbhísí a sholáthar do TikTok de réir na dtéarmaí agus na gcoinníollacha seo (an “**Comhaontú**” seo).
