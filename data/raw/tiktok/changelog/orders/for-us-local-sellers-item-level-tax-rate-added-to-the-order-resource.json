  "title": "For US local sellers: Item level tax rate added to the Order resource",
  "content": "# What is changing?\nWe've introduced a new `tax_rate` property for the Order resource. This `tax_rate` represents the item's tax rate within an order, calculated by TikTok Shop. Factors influencing this rate include US Sales Tax regulations and the product's category.\nDevelopers can access the `tax_rate` in version 202309 of the Get Order List and Get Order Detail API. For example:\n\n* API request path: `/order/202309/orders`\n* API response:\n\n```JSON\n{\n    \"code\": 0,\n    \"data\": {\n        \"orders\": [\n            {\n                \"line_items\": [\n                    {\n                        \"display_status\": \"TO_SHIP\",\n                        \"id\": \"577086512123755123\",\n                        \"is_gift\": false,\n                        \"item_tax\": [\n                            {\n                                \"tax_amount\": \"21.2\",\n                                \"tax_type\": \"SALES_TAX\",\n                                \"tax_rate\": \"0.03\"\n                            }\n                        ]\n                    }\n                ]\n            }\n        ]\n    },\n    \"message\": \"Success\",\n    \"request_id\": \"202203070749000101890810281E8C70B7\"\n}\n```\n\n# Which markets are affected?\nThe new property is applicable to **local sellers** in the US markets.\n# Who is affected?\nDevelopers utilizing version 202309 of either the Get Order List API or the Get Order Detail API will benefit from this update, enabling enhanced functionality in their applications.\n## Which version is applicable?\nThis `tax_rate` property is a feature exclusive to version 202309 of the Get Order List API or Get Order Detail API.
