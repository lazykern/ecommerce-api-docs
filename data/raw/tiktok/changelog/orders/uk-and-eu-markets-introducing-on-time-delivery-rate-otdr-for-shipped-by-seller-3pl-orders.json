OTDR is defined as the percentage of all packages (delivered over a period of 7 calendar days) that take less than **5 business days** to be delivered. \n\nFrom **August 25th, 2025**, sellers in the UK and EU using the **Shipped by Seller** (3PL) fulfillment method will receive `delivery_sla_time` data with each order, enabling better management of delivery expectations.
