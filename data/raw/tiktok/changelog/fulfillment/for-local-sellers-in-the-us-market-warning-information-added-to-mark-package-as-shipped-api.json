  "title": "For local sellers in the US market: Warning information added to Mark Package as Shipped API",
  "content": "# What is changing?\nWe added a new `warning` component to the [Mark Package As Shipped](mark-package-as-shipped) API. The new component includes the following field:\n\n* `message`: TikTok Shop validates the `tracking number` value and returns a warning message if it detects any issues, such as:\n   * The value does not match any shipping provider.\n   * The value matches multiple shipping providers.\n   * The value matches a different `shipping_provider_id` than what you passed via the API parameter.\n\nThe `message` field might contain the following warning messages:\n| Message |\n| --- |\n| Verifying order tracking number timeout. Please ensure your tracking number and logistics provider is correct. |\n| No logistics provider could be found for this tracking number. Check the tracking number and try again. |\n| The tracking number you entered matches multiple logistics providers. Ensure you select the correct logistics provider. |\n| No logistics provider or service could be found for this tracking number. Check the tracking number and try again. |\n| The tracking number you entered does not match your selected logistics provider. Check the tracking number and logistics provider. Did you mean to select {{inferred_provider_name}}? |\n## Code Sample\n```JSON\n{\n  \"code\": 0,\n  \"data\": \n  {\n    \"package_id\": \"31241234123131\",\n    \"detail\":\n    {\n        \"order_id\": \"32213123\",\n        \"Order_line_item_id\": \"231242313412234\"\n    }\n    \"warning\":\n    {\n        \"message\": \"The tracking number can not match logistics provider, please check the tracking number and shipping provider id.\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"message\": \"Success\",\n  \"request_id\": \"202203070749000101890810281E8C70B7\"\n}\n```\n\n# Which markets are affected?\nThe `warning` component is available to local sellers in the US market.\n# Who is affected?\nThis change only applies to developers with applications that use API version 202309 and the Mark Package As Shipped API to ship seller packages.\n# What action is required?\nWhen the `warning` component appears in the API response, be sure to clearly display the message to sellers and advise them to verify the accuracy of the tracking number and shipping provider information.\n\n",
