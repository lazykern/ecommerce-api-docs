Any API calls that exceed this limit will fail and return a specific error code \"17029046\".\n# Which markets are affected?\nThe update applies to the local and cross-border sellers in **ALL** the markets\n# Who is affected?\nDevelopers with applications that use [Update Activity Product](update-activity-product) and [Remove Activity Product](remove-activity-product)\n# Which version is applicable?\nThe limits apply to all versions of the related APIs\n# What action is required?\nPlease ensure your usage complies with this new limit to avoid disruptions in service.\n\n",
