Sellers must use the following integrated carriers for shipping:\n\n* Yamato\n* Sagawa Express\n* Japan Post\n* Seino Transportation\n* Seino Super Express\n\nFor local sellers, the seller shipping workflow should generally follow these steps:\n\n1. The seller ships the package and obtains the shipment tracking number from the shipping carrier.\n2. Use the [Get Shipping Providers](get-shipping-providers) endpoint to retrieve the shipping service provider IDs supported by TikTok Shop.\n3. Use the [Mark Package as Shipped](mark-package-as-shipped) endpoint to upload the tracking number and shipping provider ID.\n\n#### China cross-border (GS-POP) sellers\nChina cross-border sellers should use the following fulfillment workflows:\n| **Shipping type** | **Endpoint(s)** |\n| --- | --- |\n| Oversea warehouse | 1. The seller ships the package and obtains the shipment tracking number from the shipping carrier. <br> 2. Use the [Get Shipping Providers](get-shipping-providers) endpoint to retrieve the shipping service provider IDs supported by TikTok Shop. <br> 3. Use the [Mark Package as Shipped](mark-package-as-shipped) endpoint to upload the tracking number and shipping provider ID. |\n| Direct shipping | 1. The seller schedules the package handover time and method with the shipping provider. <br> 2. Use the [Ship Package](ship-package) endpoint to schedule the package handover time and method. <br> 3.
