  "title": "US, UK, and SEA markets: Pre-order and made-to-order product types",
  "content": "## Summary\nWe're introducing a couple of new `pre_sale` product types to better support TikTok Shop seller needs. There are a couple key business logic distinctions based on the market, as follows:\n\nFor the **US** market, this includes pre-order and made-to-order products:\n\n* **Pre-order**: The buyer can place an order for a product before a **fixed** release date set by the seller.\n* **Made-to-order**: The buyer can place an order for a customized product that is made-to-order. The shipping lead time depends on the order placement date/time, as well as the production time required for each individual order, rather than a fixed release date.\n* **Custom**: The seller can select a specific SKU and set a handling time that's longer than the platform policy of 3 business days. The estimated delivery time and late dispatch evaluation will be based on the handling time set.\n\nFor the **UK** and **SEA** markets, this is currently limited to pre-order products only:\n\n* **Pre-order**: The buyer can place an order for a product before release, but the shipping lead time depends on the order placement date/time and the production time required for each individual order, rather than a fixed release date.\n\n## Affected markets and versions\nThis change applies to the following market(s):\n\n* United States (US)\n* United Kingdom (UK)\n* Southeast Asia (SEA)\n\nThis change applies to the following API version(s):\n\n* 202309 (and later)\n\n## What's changing?\n### Product APIs\n| **Endpoint(s)** | **Change(s)** |\n| --- | --- |\n| * [Get Category Rules](get-category-rules) | New response parameter, `allowed_special_product_types`: The list of special product types that are allowed for your shop in this category.
