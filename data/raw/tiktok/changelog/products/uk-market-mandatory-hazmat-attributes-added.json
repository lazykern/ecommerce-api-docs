  "title": "UK market: Mandatory hazmat attributes added",
  "content": "## Summary\nAll new and existing products will be validated to ensure mandatory hazmat attributes have been provided where necessary. **API enforcement for new listings will begin on 5 January 2025**. Per federal regulations, hazmat products need to be properly labelled, classified, stored, fulfilled and transported by qualified stakeholders within the supply chain. These requirements apply broadly to a wide range of products. Failure to implement integration solutions will impact sellers by blocking their listings and reducing LSR.\n## What are we launching\nA dangerous good (also known as hazardous material or hazmat) is any product capable of posing an unreasonable risk to health, safety, and property during shipping, storage, and handling. These goods can contain flammable, corrosive, pressurized, or otherwise harmful substances. As a result, dangerous goods must be handled and transported with special care and safety measures and can have additional transportation requirements (such as specific marking and labeling of packages or special handling).\nSellers are responsible for identifying if their listed products qualify as dangerous goods and shipping and labeling these products in a compliant manner, according to applicable laws and regulations.\nIn order to do this, we are launching new required attributes to Get Attributes API. These attributes must be filled by the seller in order to list products in hazmat categories.\nMore information on hazmat policy and categories can be found on [Seller Academy](https://seller-us.tiktok.com/university/essay?knowledge_id=7071657567962926&role=1&course_type=1&from=search&identity=1).\n## When are we launching it\nAPI enforcement for product listings (Create and Edit Product APIs) with hazmat attributes will begin on **++January 5th++**.\n## Impact\nAll existing and new listings must comply and provide hazmat information on January 5th to avoid be taken down.\n## Which markets are impacted?\nWith this change, both US and UK market now have requirements for hazardous products. Please see the [changelog for the US market](us-market-mandatory-hazmat-attributes-added).\n## API Changes\nThese changes to the API are going to be **released on July 20, 2024.** A list of attributes names and IDs for Hazmat information:\n| **attribute.name** | **attribute.id** | **attribute.values.name** | **attribute.values.id** | **Supported input type** |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| > Contains Batteries or Cells? | 101610 | Batteries | 1024358 | Select one value for the listed options |\n|  |  | Cells | 1024359 | Select one value for the listed options |\n|  |  | None | 1000325 | Select one value for the listed options |\n|  |  | Not Sure | 1024360 | Select one value for the listed options |\n| >> Battery Type | 100216 | Lithium Ion | 1024361 | Select one value for the listed options |\n|  |  | Lithium Metal | 1023433 | Select one value for the listed options |\n|  |  | Lead/Cadmium/Mercury | 1024362 | Select one value for the listed options |\n|  |  | Alkaline | 1024363 | Select one value for the listed options |\n|  |  | Other | 1020869 | Select one value for the listed options |\n| >>> How Batteries Are Packed | 101611 | Batteries Built-In | 1024364 | Select one value for the listed options |\n|  |  | Batteries Packed Separately | 1024365 | Select one value for the listed options |\n|  |  | Batteries Only | 1024366 | Select one value for the listed options |\n| >>> Number of Batteries or cells | 101623 |  |  | Custom text input |\n| >>> Battery or Cell Capacity in Wh | 101624 |  |  | Custom text input |\n| >>> Battery or Cell Capacity in grams | 101625 |  |  | Custom text input |\n| >>> Battery or Cell Weight in grams | 101614 |  |  | Custom text input |\n| > Flammable Liquid | 101574 | Yes | 1000058 | Select one value for the listed options |\n|  |  | No | 1000059 | Select one value for the listed options |\n|  |  | Not Sure | 1024360 | Select one value for the listed options |\n| >> Flammable Liquid Volume in ml | 101626 |  |  | Custom text input |\n| > Aerosols | 101571 | Yes | 1000058 | Select one value for the listed options |\n|  |  | No | 1000059 | Select one value for the listed options |\n|  |  | Not Sure | 1024360 | Select one value for the listed options |\n| >> Aerosol Liquid Volume in ml | 101627 |  |  | Custom text input |\n| > Other Dangerous Goods or Hazardous Materials | 101619 | Yes | 1000058 | Select one value for the listed options |\n|  |  | No | 1000059 | Select one value for the listed options |\n|  |  | Not Sure | 1024360 | Select one value for the listed options |\n### 1.[Get Attributes](get-attributes)\n#### Parameters\nNo change\n#### Responses\nAdding two properties:\n\n* Adding `requirement_conditions` to response, indicating if the product attribute is required based on the conditions in this object.
