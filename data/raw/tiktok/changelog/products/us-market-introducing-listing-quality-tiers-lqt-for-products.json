To improve listing quality, Sellers will be able to see Listing Quality Tiers (LQT), a tier system for measuring listing quality (e.g., \"Poor\", \"Fair\", \"Good\"), and take action to address listing-quality issues. Information quality is a crucial factor for consumers when making purchasing decisions in online shopping. Therefore, improved product information quality directly influences customer satisfaction, trust, and conversion rates. **This change will be for the US market and will be live as of 9/29**\n### API Changes\nIn the US market, the response of [Product Information Issue Diagnosis](product-information-issue-diagnosis) API will now include a `listing_quality` object which will include a listing quality indicator (e.g., \"POOR\", \"FAIR\", \"GOOD\", \"EXCELLENT\") along with recommendations on what changes to make to get it to the next level, if possible.\n#### Product Information Issue Diagnosis (v202405)\nSellers and Developers managing Products through the API channel can use this API to obtain LQT-related data and optimization recommendations to improve listing quality of their products.\n\n* You can now query up to 200 products\n* In US, this endpoint will also return a `listing quality` object with the following properties:\n   * current_tier (string)\n   * remaining_recommendations (int)\n   * *NOTE:* The response \"NA\" represents null.
