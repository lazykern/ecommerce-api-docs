With this change, fields in the response body are now static. We hope this change improves developer experience and productivity.\n# What are the affected markets?\nThis change is applicable to all markets.\n# Who is affected?\nAll seller types can benefit from this change.\n# Which version are these changes for?\nThis change is only for v202312, which is available for the Check Listing Prerequisite API. Upgrade to v202312 to benefit from a better development experience from a more RESTful API.\n# Required Actions\nWe recommend adopting this new version and updating your code with the refactored fields.
