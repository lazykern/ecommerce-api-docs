  "content": "## Summary\nWhen calling [Edit Product](edit-product) and [Partial Edit Product APIs](partial-edit-product), the **price** and **inventory** fields are now optional. This change applies to all markets, and both cross-boar and local sellers. Developers integrated with v202309 version of these endpoints can leverage these changes.\n## What is changing\nThe schema of both [Edit Product](edit-product) and [Partial Edit Product APIs](partial-edit-product) have been changed so that `price` and `inventory` are not required anymore. If you omit these objects in the API request, the existing price and inventory will remain unchanged.\n## What action is required\nNo action is required unless you are a developer who will gain flexibility by omitting the above fields.\n## What markets and version is affected\nThis change applies to all markets and all sellers.\n\n",
