  "title": "For the ES and IE market: Updates to Mandatory Certifications for Certain Product Categories",
  "content": "## Summary\nAs of **9 December, 2024** all local sellers in the EU market will need to ensure all the relevant information around food labeling. Developers will need to require merchants to provide product marking and labeling certificates so that they can be displayed on the product detail page as per regulations. After December 9th, failure to provide these certifications will result in product listing failures.\n## API Changes\nThe relevant APIs for this change are *Create Product*, *Edit Product*, *Partial Edit Product*, and *Get Category Rule*.\nFor the ES and IE market, TikTok Shop is implementing new Mandatory Certifications for certain product categories. Starting from 2024-12-09, Products API will be updated to require Mandatory Certifications.\nWithout mandatory product certifications for products within specific categories, sellers will not be able to create and update products.\nMost product categories will require labeling as the new mandatory certification. Use the Get Category Rule to check what product certifications are required and pass the product certification files via the Create Product, Edit Product, and Partial Edit Product to help sellers submit product certification.\n| Category | Product Marking and Safety information | Recommendations |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Cosmetics | Cosmetic Labelling which includes: <br>  <br> * Ingredients list <br> * Cautions & Warnings | Sellers must include clear images of the product's label and package, along with displaying essential information in local official language, such as ingredients, precautions for use, and the date on which the cosmetic product can be used. ![Image](https://sf16-sg.tiktokcdn.com/obj/eden-sg/jvK_ylwvslclK_JWZ%5B%5B/ljhwZthlaukjlkulzlp/Changelog/EU%20Product%20Certifications/670e2527889b3d031da5d253-cosmetics.png) <br>  |\n| Electrical products and electronics | Electrical & Electronic Labelling which includes <br>  <br> * CE, WEEE <br> * Cautions & Warnings <br>  <br> User Manual <br> Energy Labelling and Product Information Sheet | Sellers must upload clear images featuring essential information in local official language, such as the product's CE marking, applicable warnings, WEEE labels, and instructions. ![Image](https://sf16-sg.tiktokcdn.com/obj/eden-sg/jvK_ylwvslclK_JWZ%5B%5B/ljhwZthlaukjlkulzlp/Changelog/EU%20Product%20Certifications/670e2527889b3d031da5d253-electronics.png) <br>  |\n| Toys | Toys Labelling and Age labelling which includes: <br>  <br> * CE marks <br> * Warnings including age suitability e.g. not suitable for children under 36 months | Sellers must upload clear images featuring essential information in local official language , such as the product's CE marking, applicable (age) warnings, instructions, and WEEE labels if applicable. ![Image](https://sf16-sg.tiktokcdn.com/obj/eden-sg/jvK_ylwvslclK_JWZ%5B%5B/ljhwZthlaukjlkulzlp/Changelog/EU%20Product%20Certifications/670e2527889b3d031da5d253-toys.png) <br>  |\n| Food | Food labelling which includes but is not limited to the name of the food, the list of ingredients, the quantity of certain ingredients or categories of ingredients, the net quantity of the food, any special storage conditions and/or conditions of use, the name or business name and address of the food business operator, the country of origin or place of provenance, instructions for use where it would be difficult to make appropriate use of the food in the absence of such instructions, a nutrition declaration | Sellers must include clear images of the product's label and package and display essential information in local official language, such as ingredients, usage instructions, and country of manufacture/origin. ![Image](https://sf16-sg.tiktokcdn.com/obj/eden-sg/jvK_ylwvslclK_JWZ%5B%5B/ljhwZthlaukjlkulzlp/Changelog/EU%20Product%20Certifications/670e2527889b3d031da5d253-food.png) <br>  |\n| All other product categories | Image of Packaging | Please upload a clear product packaging photo including the product labelling, the name of the product, manufacturer name and address, any marking and any applicable warning in official language. ![Image](https://sf16-sg.tiktokcdn.com/obj/eden-sg/jvK_ylwvslclK_JWZ%5B%5B/ljhwZthlaukjlkulzlp/Changelog/EU%20Product%20Certifications/670e2527889b3d031da5d253-other.png) <br>  |\n## Affected Markets\nThe updates of the requirements apply to the local sellers in the ES and IE markets\n\n",
