  "content": "# **Summary**\nTo help developers identify and handle errors better, we've refined several ambiguous error codes by either splitting them into more precise error codes, or replacing them with more appropriate error codes. These changes provide clearer context on what went wrong. The error conditions remain the same, only the codes associated with them have changed for clarity.\n# **Impact**\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Impacted market(s) | All |\n| Impacted version(s) | 202309 (and later) |\n# **What is changing?**\n| **Original error code** | **Original scenario** | **Newly assigned error code** | **Newly assigned scenario** | **Affected endpoints** |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 12052032 <!-- rowSpan:4 --> | The product does not exist <!-- rowSpan:4 --> | No change in code | The product does not exist.

If needed, update your logic to support the new error codes to maintain consistent functionality. Refer to the respective API Reference documentation for details.\n\n",
