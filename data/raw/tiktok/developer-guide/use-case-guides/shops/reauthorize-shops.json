First, you can check the expiration date of the customer's TikTok Shop refresh token. Second, you can use the [upcoming authorization expiration webhook](7-upcoming-authorization-expiration).\n## Check the TikTok Shop refresh token expiration date\nIn this use case, choose an appropriate time interval to retrieve your customer's `refresh_token_expire_in` data that you've stored previously. If the `refresh_token` is set to expire within a predetermined time period, display a user interface to your customer prompting them to authorize your TikTok Shop App.\n## Implement an upcoming authorization expiration webhook listener\n![Image](https://sf16-sg.tiktokcdn.com/obj/eden-sg/jvK_ylwvslclK_JWZ%5B%5B/ljhwZthlaukjlkulzlp/Developer_Guide/Integration%20Guides/manage_shop_webhook.png)\nThe call flow is:\n\n1. Your webhook listener is pinged by the TikTok Shop upcoming authorization expiration webhook listener. The webhook payload includes a `shop_id` field, a `timestamp` field, and a `data` object that includes a formatted `message` and the `expiration_time` in Unix epoch format.\n2. Store the data, indexed to your customer identifier associated with the `shop_id`. When the customer logs in to your service, display a message informing your customer that their TikTok Shop authorization is expiring soon. You can either direct them to the TikTok Shop Partner Center to reauthorize, or you can implement a button that the customer can click to go directly there.\n\n## Next steps\nNow that you've implemented an authorization expiration webhook listener, you can add functionality to [disconnect a shop](disconnecting-shops).\n\n",
