  "title": "API entity tags",
  "content": "In the TikTok Shop API Reference, each endpoint is grouped under one **entity tag**. These tags enable developers to quickly understand:\n\n* The type of entity the API operates on (e.g., seller, shop, partner, creator, asset) and its access boundaries\n* The type of authorization required (e.g., shop token, seller token)\n\nThis organization provides developers with clear context about each endpoint's scope, and use it correctly within their integration.\n\n![Image](https://sf16-sg.tiktokcdn.com/obj/eden-sg/jvK_ylwvslclK_JWZ[[/ljhwZthlaukjlkulzlp/Developer_Guide/TikTok_Shop_API_concepts/api_entity_tag.png)\nExample of an API entity tag\n# Types of entity tag\n## Seller tag\nEndpoints with the `Seller` tag operate at the **seller account level**. A [seller access token](authorization-overview-202407#Get%20Access%20Token%20API) is required to access the seller's data.\nThese endpoints are mainly used to manage seller-level data that support cross-shop operations. This includes seller-wide metadata (e.g. retrieving shops owned by the seller), reusable assets (e.g. uploading shop-agnostic images), and global product data used to replicate local product listings across multiple shops (e.g. creating global product).\nThey cannot be used to access or manage individual local shop data such as local products or a shop's orders.\n## Shop tag\nEndpoints with the `Shop` tag operate at the **local shop level**. A [seller access token](authorization-overview-202407#Get%20Access%20Token%20API) and a [shop cipher](get-authorized-shops) is required to access the shop data. Each shop has its own shop cipher, and the data is isolated from other shops.\nThese endpoints are mainly used to manage data within a shop, such as listing a product in a shop, retrieving its orders, and so on.\nThey cannot be used to access or manage data that spans across multiple shops under the same seller account.\n## Account tag\nEndpoints with the `Account` tag operate at the **partner account level.** A [partner access token](authorization-overview-202407#Get%20Access%20Token%20API) is required to access the partner's data.\nThese endpoints are mainly used for managing data related to the partner account, such as retrieving the list of business category assets that a partner has authorized for an app.\nThey cannot be used to access or manage a partner's campaign assets directly.\n## Creator tag\nEndpoints with the `Creator` tag operate at the **creator account level.** A [creator access token](authorization-overview-202407#Get%20Access%20Token%20API) is required to access the creator's data.\nThese endpoints are mainly used to manage data related to a creator, such as obtaining a creator's profile, retrieving affiliate orders generated by the creator, searching for open collaboration items, and so on.\n## Asset tag\nEndpoints with the `Asset` tag operate at the **partner's campaign asset level**. A [partner access token](authorization-overview-202407#Get%20Access%20Token%20API) and the relevant [category asset cipher](get-authorized-category-assets) is required to access a partner's campaign data.\nThese endpoints are mainly used to manage affiliate marketing campaigns and handle campaign products.\n\n",
