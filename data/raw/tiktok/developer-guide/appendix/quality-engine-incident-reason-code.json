  "content": "For developers who have integrated with Quality Engine, when there are some incidents, developers need to sync incident reason by reason code of the list. It can help the system to identify risk order and A-LOC order with higher accuracy and then we can provide more efficient suggestions for sellers/developers to resolve the issues. And it also is very helpful to improve our system performance.\nTo sync reason code, developers need:\n\n1. Syncing enumeration of reason code on the list via Quality Engine data exchanging API.\n2. Using codes on the list, any codes out of the list will be forbidden to sync by Quality Engine.\n3. Using correct code, developers need to pay attention to the description of code and sync the most reasonable code for the specific incident.\n4. Using the code which is suitable for the rule, every reason code has its suitable rules, developers need to follow the mapping relationship on the list.\n\nReason Code List:\n\n1.
