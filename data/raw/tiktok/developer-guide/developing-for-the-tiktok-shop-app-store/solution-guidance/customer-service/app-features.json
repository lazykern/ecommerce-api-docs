This eliminates the need to log in to Seller Center to manage customer messages, and allows customer service agents to reply to messages directly on their Customer support platform. This article applies to Third-party Independent Service Vendors (ISV) or self-developed merchants who access the TikTok Shop Customer Service functions.\n![Image](https://p16-arcosite-va.ibyteimg.com/tos-maliva-i-10qhjjqwgv-us/92ac169de3614f8ca96c68f6787230aa~tplv-10qhjjqwgv-image.image)\nSellers can authorize third-party software or systems to use the Customer Service open interface to obtain Customer Service data and functions through the authorization page of the workbench.\nThe Customer Service open interface will provide capabilities including: A customer service session list, session status, sending pictures, etc., and support merchants to receive and reply to consumer TTS Customer Service messages on third-party systems.\nWith the Customer Service API, you can build applications that send messages to customers, obtain session lists, session messages, and new event hooks, obtaining and setting customer service agent status. You can get a list of message types that are available for an order that you specify, then call the operation that creates a new conversation to send a message to the customer for that order. By integrating Customer Service Open API with your third-party systems, you will centralize your customer support efforts, maintain better communication control, and provide a consistent customer experience.\n## Apply for the API\nCustomer Service is a custom API available in TTSPC, visible to partners/ ISVs who have selected Customer Service as the business category in 'Category & Market' and service category in 'app or service'.\nCustomer Service API is inactive by default and the partner/ ISV has to apply for access, which requires approval from your Account Manager or Partner Manager to activate the API to build applications.\n![Image](https://p16-arcosite-va.ibyteimg.com/tos-maliva-i-10qhjjqwgv-us/bd21e735517848bcb353d7bb9857f4a2~tplv-10qhjjqwgv-image.image)\n[Read more](access-scope)\n# App Features\n| **Use Case ID** <!-- width:100px --> | **Use Case Summary** <!-- width:350px --> | **Required** <!-- width:75px --> | **Tags** <!-- width:150px --> | **Scopes** |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| [SHOP-CONN-SINGLE](https://partner.tiktokshop.com/openlearn/guide/usecase?parent_id=7256668359047202561) | The application **must** be able to connect one store from the platform to one shop in TikTok Shop. | Yes | * Shop Connections | * Shop Authorized Information(431812) <br> * Global Shop Information(431300) |\n| [SHOP-CONN-MULTI](https://partner.tiktokshop.com/openlearn/guide/usecase?parent_id=7256668359047202561) | The application may be able to connect one store from the platform to multiple shops in TikTok Shop. | No | * Shop Connections | * Shop Authorized Information(431812) <br> * Global Shop Information(431300) |\n| [SHOP-DISCON-SINGLE](https://partner.tiktokshop.com/openlearn/guide/usecase?parent_id=7418535282326341377) | The application **must** be able to disconnect one store from the platform to one shop in TikTok Shop. | Yes | * Shop Connections | * Shop Authorized Information(431812) <br> * Global Shop Information(431300) |\n| [SHOP-MAN-MULTI](https://partner.tiktokshop.com/openlearn/guide/usecase?parent_id=7256668359047251713) | The application **must** be able to manage shop connections by adding new ones or removing existing ones. | Yes | * Shop Connections | * Shop Authorized Information(431812) <br> * Global Shop Information(431300) |\n| [SHOP-MAN-WHOOK](https://partner.tiktokshop.com/openlearn/guide/usecase?parent_id=7256668359047251713) | The application **must** be able to use the Upcoming Authorization Expiration webhook to notify sellers to re-authorize their shop connection. | Yes | * Shop Connections | * Shop Authorized Information(431812) <br> * Global Shop Information(431300) |\n| [SHOP-MAN-CARRIER](https://partner.tiktokshop.com/openlearn/guide/usecase?parent_id=7256668359047251713) | The application **must** be able to map shipping carriers on the platform to the corresponding ones on TikTok Shop. | Yes | * Shop Connections | * Shop Authorized Information(431812) <br> * Global Shop Information(431300) |\n| [CS-INMSG-TXT](https://partner.tiktokshop.com/openlearn/guide/usecase?parent_id=7462987361052526353) | The customer service application **must** enable the seller to receive the TikTok Shop buyer's plain text messages on the customer service application.
