This includes before, during, and after development.\n\n\nWe hope you will gain a better understanding of:\n\n* The different categories we support, and the features supported within each category. Each *feature* can have one or more *use cases*.\n* The API integration flow for each use case.

Once it is ready to launch, you can convert it into a **public** app for review.\n* Once development is finished, the app will be reviewed and tested by our team members. Please ensure you have set up the test accounts, and have shared them with our team.\n* After a proposed public app has been reviewed, it will be published to the TikTok Shop Seller Center App Store.\n\n# Before development\n\n* Familiarize yourself with the TikTok Shop Partner Center.\n* Request the appropriate markets and categories you are developing for.\n   * 📌 <span style=\"color: orange\"><strong>Note</strong></span><span style=\"color: orange\">: If you would like to develop for both the UK and US markets, you must create two separate Partner Center accounts.
