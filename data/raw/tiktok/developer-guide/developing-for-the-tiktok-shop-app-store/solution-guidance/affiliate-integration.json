  "content": "# Background\nTikTok Shop is excited to launch a new category of APIs focused on affiliate marketing on TikTok Shop.\nThese APIs will provide Sellers, Creator Affiliates, and TikTok Shop Partners more efficient ways to create, manage, matchmake, track, monetize, and collaborate across TikTok Shop Affiliate Collaborations and Partner Campaigns.\n\n\n<span style=\"color: blue\">✏️ </span><span style=\"color: blue\"><strong>Test Credentials</strong></span>\n<span style=\"color: blue\">Partner Center:</span>\n\n* <span style=\"color: blue\">Use Development Shops as shown in this guide.</span>\n\n<span style=\"color: blue\">Affiliate Center/Seller Center:</span>\n\n* <span style=\"color: blue\">Use the ones associated with your Development Shop.</span>\n\n<span style=\"color: blue\">Test Creator:</span>\n\n* <span style=\"color: blue\">86 12341968831, 003615 ( Ymd_ttp_8831, 7205096607046632494 )</span>\n* <span style=\"color: blue\">86 12343432801, 007424 ( testdziwjtmwbq, 7400230764149244970 )</span>\n\n\n**Affiliate API is inactive by default and the partner/ ISV has to apply for access, which requires approval from your Account Manager or Partner Manager to activate the API to build applications.**\n## Partner account setup\n\n1. Refer to [Register as a service partner](tsp-onboarding) to register yourself. Ensure you select the following values during registration.\n   * **Business Guide**: For app developers (ISVs)\n   * **Category**: App developer > Customer Engagement > Affiliate\n      ![Image](https://sf16-sg.tiktokcdn.com/obj/eden-sg/jvK_ylwvslclK_JWZ%5B%5B/ljhwZthlaukjlkulzlp/Developer_Guide/Affiliate%20Integration/partner_account_setup1.png?x-resource-account=public)\n2. Go to **App & Service** and create the following apps:\n   * Affiliate (public): For launching an official app on the TikTok Shop App Store.\n   * Affiliate (custom): For testing purposes.\n   * Connector (custom): For obtaining necessary access to non-affiliate APIs.\n3. Initiate a compliance review for the **Affiliate (public)** app by referring to [Publish and list a Public App](publish-and-list-public-app).\n4. Provide your **app key** (a 14 character long key, not the App ID or Partner ID) to your partner manager so that we can list you for creator authorization. Creator authorization is necessary for accessing Creator APIs.\n5. Begin development of integration once API accessibility is granted.\n\n## Development shop setup\n![Image](https://sf16-sg.tiktokcdn.com/obj/eden-sg/jvK_ylwvslclK_JWZ%5B%5B/ljhwZthlaukjlkulzlp/Developer_Guide/Affiliate%20Integration/development_shop_setup2.png?x-resource-account=public)\n![Image](https://sf16-sg.tiktokcdn.com/obj/eden-sg/jvK_ylwvslclK_JWZ%5B%5B/ljhwZthlaukjlkulzlp/Developer_Guide/Affiliate%20Integration/development_shop_setup1.png?x-resource-account=public)\n## Development shop Seller Center setup\n### Tax information\nProvide dummy information to fulfill this requirement.\nNavigate to [Seller Center](https://seller-us.tiktok.com/homepage) and there should be a banner similar to the following:\n![Image](https://sf16-sg.tiktokcdn.com/obj/eden-sg/jvK_ylwvslclK_JWZ%5B%5B/ljhwZthlaukjlkulzlp/Developer_Guide/Affiliate%20Integration/seller_center_banner.png?x-resource-account=public)\nClick **Verify Now** on this banner and you should be greeted with a tax form as shown below. You may use the same values as shown in this example.\n![Image](https://sf16-sg.tiktokcdn.com/obj/eden-sg/jvK_ylwvslclK_JWZ%5B%5B/ljhwZthlaukjlkulzlp/Developer_Guide/Affiliate%20Integration/seller_center_tax_information.png?x-resource-account=public)\n![Image](https://sf16-sg.tiktokcdn.com/obj/eden-sg/jvK_ylwvslclK_JWZ%5B%5B/ljhwZthlaukjlkulzlp/Developer_Guide/Affiliate%20Integration/seller_center_tax_information2.png?x-resource-account=public)\nWhen you click **Submit**, you will be prompted with a confirmation box, where you are asked to sign. It might look intimidating, but this is a test account and we just need to fulfill some requirements.\n![Image](https://sf16-sg.tiktokcdn.com/obj/eden-sg/jvK_ylwvslclK_JWZ%5B%5B/ljhwZthlaukjlkulzlp/Developer_Guide/Affiliate%20Integration/seller_center_tax_signature.png?x-resource-account=public)\n\n<span style=\"color: orange\">📌 </span><span style=\"color: orange\"><strong>Note</strong></span><span style=\"color: orange\">: You may have to set up your origin and return warehouses and set up shipping templates. Please refer to these support articles on configuring your warehouses and shipping templates:</span>\n\n* [Shipping templates](https://seller-us.tiktok.com/university/essay?knowledge_id=6837882170099457&role=1&course_type=1&from=search&identity=1&anchor_link=EC4200CA)\n* [Warehouses](https://seller-us.tiktok.com/university/essay?knowledge_id=6837882170099457&role=1&course_type=1&from=search&identity=1&anchor_link=EBCE00CE)\n\nOnce you have submitted the tax information, your development shop setup is complete and ready to accept product listings.\n### Product listing example\nAs an example, let's say we have a product that we want creators to showcase. They will need an affiliate link to share with their followers to purchase this product. This helps streamline the purchasing process, and tracks sales on a creator or product segment. Here are some example screenshots of how you may list the product via Seller Center. You are also welcome to create them using the API.\n<span style=\"color: orange\">📌 </span><span style=\"color: orange\"><strong>Note</strong></span><span style=\"color: orange\">: It's recommended to choose </span><span style=\"color: orange\"><strong>No Brand</strong></span><span style=\"color: orange\"> if created via Seller Center.</span>\n**Product 1**\n![Image](https://sf16-sg.tiktokcdn.com/obj/eden-sg/jvK_ylwvslclK_JWZ%5B%5B/ljhwZthlaukjlkulzlp/Developer_Guide/Affiliate%20Integration/product_listing_example1.png?x-resource-account=public)\n**Product 2**\n![Image](https://sf16-sg.tiktokcdn.com/obj/eden-sg/jvK_ylwvslclK_JWZ%5B%5B/ljhwZthlaukjlkulzlp/Developer_Guide/Affiliate%20Integration/product_listing_example2.png?x-resource-account=public)\nOnce the product is created, you should see them with a **Live** status after approval.\n![Image](https://sf16-sg.tiktokcdn.com/obj/eden-sg/jvK_ylwvslclK_JWZ%5B%5B/ljhwZthlaukjlkulzlp/Developer_Guide/Affiliate%20Integration/product_listing_live.png?x-resource-account=public)\nCongratulations! The product is now ready to be added to an open collaboration! Let's go to Affiliate Center by clicking on **Affiliate** on the left. Scroll down and click on **Go to TikTok Shop Affiliate homepage**. This will open Affiliate Center in a new tab. You can also use [this link here](https://affiliate-us.tiktok.com/errorpage?) and it should automatically log in.\n## Seller onboarding\nSeller Center authorization is required to get information on all products a seller has for sale. Sellers can set up open collaborations where any creator is welcome join, or set up targeted collaborations with specific partners. To enable all of these via API, a seller must connect their TikTok Seller Center account so that you can manage their affiliates, products, and orders.\nTo understand all the steps involved in authorizing your application, please see the [Seller Authorization Guide](seller-authorization-guide) in Partner Center. Once authorized, you should:\n\n* Verify the connection by calling the [Get Authorized Shops API](get-authorized-shops) and comparing the response to the values in Seller Center.\n* Call the [Search Products API](search-products) to obtain a list of products and their corresponding Product IDs needed for future API calls.\n\n## Creator onboarding\nBefore you can send targeted collaborations or invite them to campaigns, you need to get the creator to connect their TikTok account with your application.\n\n* Ask them to log in to TikTok using your creator authorization link. It will be in the form:\n   `shop.tiktok.com/alliance/creator/auth?app_key=<app_key>&state=<state>`\n\n<span style=\"color: red\">❗ </span><span style=\"color: red\"><strong>Important</strong></span><span style=\"color: red\">: The </span><span style=\"color: red\"><strong>state</strong></span><span style=\"color: red\"> parameter is required for creator authorization links.</span>\n\n* This will prompt the creator to log in with their TikTok Account.\n* Once they login successfully, they will see a screen resembling the following:\n   ![Image](https://sf16-sg.tiktokcdn.com/obj/eden-sg/jvK_ylwvslclK_JWZ%5B%5B/ljhwZthlaukjlkulzlp/Developer_Guide/Affiliate%20Integration/creator_onboarding1.jpg?x-resource-account=public)\n* When they click the **Authorize** button, TikTok Shop will send you to the redirect link specified in the app settings. For example, if the redirect link is `http://localhost:8000`, then the redirect URL will look like: `http://localhost:8000?code=<redacted>&state=<state>&app_key=<app_key>`.\n* Use the code from the redirect URL to call the **GET Access Token** endpoint, which will grant you access to call the Affiliate Creator endpoints.\n\n<span style=\"color: orange\">📌 </span><span style=\"color: orange\"><strong>Note</strong></span><span style=\"color: orange\">: This process is the same as getting an access token for your Seller Center account, but there are two distinct access tokens, one for the seller account and one for the creator account.</span>\n\n* The **GET Creator Profile** endpoint will give you the `creator_user_id` needed to successfully call APIs for creating a targeted collaboration.\n\nPlease refer to our [creator authorization guide](creator-authorization-guide) in the TikTok Shop Partner Center for detailed information on how to connect these accounts.\n## API scope mapping\n<span style=\"color: green\">💡 </span><span style=\"color: green\"><strong>Tip</strong></span><span style=\"color: green\">: You can directly search the API name in the </span><span style=\"color: green\"><strong>Manage API</strong></span><span style=\"color: green\"> modal by clicking on the dropdown next to </span><span style=\"color: green\"><strong>Scope Name</strong></span><span style=\"color: green\"> and selecting one of the items from the lists that are under the </span><span style=\"color: green\"><strong>API Names</strong></span><span style=\"color: green\"> column.</span>\n![Image](https://sf16-sg.tiktokcdn.com/obj/eden-sg/jvK_ylwvslclK_JWZ%5B%5B/ljhwZthlaukjlkulzlp/Developer_Guide/Affiliate%20Integration/api_scope_mapping.png?x-resource-account=public)\n| Scope ID | Scope Name | API Names |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 434372 | Affiliate Information | * Check Anchor Content <br> * Check Anchor Prerequisites <br> * Get Creator Profile <br> * Get Live Room Info <br> * Get Shop Products |\n| 733764 | Read Seller Affiliate Collaborations | * Search Seller Affiliate Orders <br> * Seller Search Affiliate Open Collaboration Product |\n| 890884 | Manage Seller Affiliate Collaboration | * Create Open Collaboration <br> * Create Target Collaboration <br> * Edit Open Collaboration Settings <br> * Generate Affiliate Product Promotion Link <br> * Remove Creator Affiliate from Collaboration |\n| 1021508 | Read Creator Affiliate Collaborations | * Creator Search Open Collaboration Product <br> * Search Creator Affiliate Orders <br> * Search Creator Target Collaborations |\n| 733508 | Read Affiliate Partner Campaigns | * Get Affiliate Partner Campaign Detail <br> * Get Affiliate Partner Campaign List <br> * Get Affiliate Partner Campaign Product List |\n| 733444 | Manage Affiliate Partner Campaigns | * Create Affiliate Partner Campaign <br> * Edit Affiliate Partner Campaign <br> * Publish Affiliate Partner Campaign |\n| 733572 | Manage Affiliate Partner Campaign Products | * Review Affiliate Partner Campaign Product |\n# Use cases\n## Generating an affiliate product promotion link\nFor products that are live, you can generate product promotion links by calling the [Generate Affiliate Product Promotion Link API](generate-affiliate-product-promotion-link). You can only create one promotion link per API call as the product ID is part of the path parameter.\n```curl\ncurl --location --globoff --request POST 'https://open-api.tiktokglobalshop.com/affiliate_seller/202405/products/1729570313535393936/promotion_link/generate?app_key=6d0ut2ttps2io&shop_cipher=TTP_YaVduQAAAACwxSc13yKds1NldAZaPw34&sign=c2a149d480ae59b6eaf0ceebe1173d7fbb831a4227406a9008c0565535b42ebe&timestamp=1723135734' \\\n--header 'content-type: application/json' \\\n--header 'x-tts-access-token: <token>' \\\n--data ''\n\n{\n    \"code\": 0,\n    \"data\": {\n        \"product_promotion_link\": \"https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZTNgEQFGa/\"\n    },\n    \"message\": \"Success\",\n    \"request_id\": \"20240808165018109CFA6CCA917E04CBAD\"\n}\n```\n\n![Image](https://sf16-sg.tiktokcdn.com/obj/eden-sg/jvK_ylwvslclK_JWZ%5B%5B/ljhwZthlaukjlkulzlp/Developer_Guide/Affiliate%20Integration/open_collaboration1.png?x-resource-account=public)\n<span style=\"color: red\">❗ </span><span style=\"color: red\"><strong>Important</strong></span><span style=\"color: red\">: You can only add </span><span style=\"color: red\"><strong>one</strong></span><span style=\"color: red\"> product to an open collaboration.</span>\n\nTo create an open collaboration, follow these steps:\n\n* Add product to open collaboration using a product ID and commission rate (e.g. 1234) by calling the [Create Open Collaboration API](create-open-collaboration).\n   * If successful, the response should include effective time, ID (open collaboration ID 87620110221), and the product ID that's part of the collaboration.\n   * If you want to edit the commission rate or the approve creator toggle, simply call the API again with the new settings.

To enable this feature, you must integrate with the [Creator Search Open Collaboration Product API](creator-search-open-collaboration-product) (cURL below). The API accepts a product title search, the product's price, the product's category, and the collaboration's commission and returns a list of open collaborations published by that seller, which creators are free to join. Some of them have screening processes where the seller has to approve the creator after review.\n```curl\ncurl --location --globoff 'https://open-api.tiktokglobalshop.com/affiliate_seller/202405/open_collaborations/products/search?app_key=6d0ut2ttps2io&shop_cipher=TTP_bCWokAAAAAA6xm9rY_B9wYFY2QltXcs9&sign={{sign}}&timestamp={{timestamp}}&page_size=10' \\\n--header 'content-type: application/json' \\\n--header 'x-tts-access-token: <redacted>' \\\n--data '{\n    \"category\": {\n        \"id\": \"601755\"\n    },\n    \"title_keywords\": [\n        \"Open Collaboration Pink\"\n    ],\n    \"sales_price_range\": {\n        \"amount_ge\": \"3.99\",\n        \"amount_lt\": \"4.99\"\n    },\n    \"commission_rate_range\": {\n        \"rate_ge\": 1233,\n        \"rate_lt\": 1235\n    }\n}'\n\n{\n    \"code\": 0,\n    \"data\": {\n        \"next_page_token\": \"\",\n        \"products\": [\n            {\n                \"category_chains\": [\n                    {\n                        \"id\": \"601755\",\n                        \"is_leaf\": false,\n                        \"local_name\": \"Computers & Office Equipment\",\n                        \"parent_id\": \"0\"\n                    },\n                    {\n                        \"id\": \"831112\",\n                        \"is_leaf\": false,\n                        \"local_name\": \"Office Stationery & Supplies\",\n                        \"parent_id\": \"601755\"\n                    },\n                    {\n                        \"id\": \"855560\",\n                        \"is_leaf\": true,\n                        \"local_name\": \"Cards\",\n                        \"parent_id\": \"831112\"\n                    }\n                ],\n                \"commission\": {\n                    \"amount\": \"0.4319\",\n                    \"currency\": \"USD\",\n                    \"rate\": 1234\n                },\n                \"detail_link\": \"https://shop.tiktok.com/view/product/1729570313535393936?region=US&local=en\",\n                \"has_inventory\": true,\n                \"id\": \"1729570313535393936\",\n                \"main_image_url\": \"https://p16-oec-ttp.tiktokcdn-us.com/tos-useast5-i-omjb5zjo8w-tx/c9052b2b9d5248c1a552d5fe15a892d5~tplv-omjb5zjo8w-origin-webp.webp?from=1695864008\",\n                \"original_price\": {\n                    \"currency\": \"USD\",\n                    \"maximum_amount\": \"4.19\",\n                    \"minimum_amount\": \"4.19\"\n                },\n                \"sale_region\": \"US\",\n                \"sales_price\": {\n                    \"currency\": \"USD\",\n                    \"maximum_amount\": \"3.5\",\n                    \"minimum_amount\": \"3.5\"\n                },\n                \"shop\": {\n                    \"name\": \"SANDBOX7398293016815273770\"\n                },\n                \"title\": \"Open Collaboration Coffee Pink Color Meme Card Smiling Lady\",\n                \"units_sold\": 5\n            }\n        ],\n        \"total_count\": 1\n    },\n    \"message\": \"Success\",\n    \"request_id\": \"202408081849481CCE26F7477A910041E1\"\n}\n```\n\nIf a creator clicks on the `detail_link` on their phone under any product, it opens up the TikTok app and shows the product display page (PDP) with the collaboration details under it. In the example below, it is the text \"Earn 0.52 on each product sold\" right above the **Buy Now** button.\n\n\nClicking on this expands the menu with options like requesting a free sample or shoppable video (if applicable), and a main call to action for them to add the product to their showcase. For example, a fashion-based creator can search for open collaborations with sellers that are producing high-quality T-shirts using this API. The creator can enter what commission rate they would like to earn and the style of the T-shirt by passing it to the product's title search.\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ![Image](https://sf16-sg.tiktokcdn.com/obj/eden-sg/jvK_ylwvslclK_JWZ%5B%5B/ljhwZthlaukjlkulzlp/Developer_Guide/Affiliate%20Integration/open_collaboration3.PNG?x-resource-account=public) <br>  | ![Image](https://sf16-sg.tiktokcdn.com/obj/eden-sg/jvK_ylwvslclK_JWZ%5B%5B/ljhwZthlaukjlkulzlp/Developer_Guide/Affiliate%20Integration/open_collaboration4.PNG?x-resource-account=public) <br>  | ![Image](https://sf16-sg.tiktokcdn.com/obj/eden-sg/jvK_ylwvslclK_JWZ%5B%5B/ljhwZthlaukjlkulzlp/Developer_Guide/Affiliate%20Integration/open_collaboration5.PNG?x-resource-account=public) <br>  |\n\n### Removing a creator from a collaboration\nIf for any reason you would like to remove a creator from an open collaboration, you can call the [Remove Creator Affiliate from Collaboration API](remove-creator-from-open-collaboration).\n<span style=\"color: orange\">📌 </span><span style=\"color: orange\"><strong>Note</strong></span><span style=\"color: orange\">: In the current API version, this will remove the creator but does not prevent them from rejoining with the affiliate link.</span>\n```curl\ncurl --location --globoff 'https://open-api.tiktokglobalshop.com/affiliate_seller/202405/open_collaborations/129916503437/remove_creator?app_key=6d0ut2ttps2io&shop_cipher=TTP_bCWokAAAAAA6xm9rY_B9wYFY2QltXcs9&sign=b61b7a13d73cf242f95d9f8ff8f0d46689af5ceba70749f5a267dac54c370869&timestamp=1723143673' \\\n--header 'content-type: application/json' \\\n--header 'x-tts-access-token: <redacted' \\\n--data '{\n    \"creator_user_id\": \"7400230764149244970\",\n    \"product_id\": \"1729568997216587962\"\n}'\n\n{\n    \"code\": 0,\n    \"data\": {},\n    \"message\": \"Success\",\n    \"request_id\": \"20240808190113870E01A8EAB8AF006987\"\n}\n```\n\n## Creating a targeted collaboration\nTo successfully invite creators to a targeted collaboration, you will need a list of creator user IDs, and up to 50 creators can be invited per one API call. This means you will need to have creators authorized as per the [Creator Authorization link here](creator-authorization-guide) and have a unique access token to modify the creator's TikTok account.\nTo create a targeted collaboration, follow these steps:\n\n* Call the [Get Creator Profile API](get-creator-profile) with the creator access token to get creator user IDs if you do not have them stored in your database:\n\n```curl\ncurl --location --globoff 'https://open-api.tiktokglobalshop.com/affiliate_creator/202405/profiles?app_key=6d0ut2ttps2io&sign=4ba5a9531b4c2196cdefde923c270259363398d3fcd05074c0c9302e07f77576&timestamp=1723144188' \\\n--header 'content-type: application/json' \\\n--header 'x-tts-access-token: <creator_token>' \\\n--data ''\n\n{\n    \"code\": 0,\n    \"data\": {\n        \"avatar\": {\n            \"url\": \"https://p16-sign-va.tiktokcdn.com/musically-maliva-obj/1594805258216454~c5_100x100.webp?lk3s=a5d48078&nonce=51354&refresh_token=4cda6b090dcbd9854fe8aa7ec2297662&x-expires=1723312800&x-signature=y9Z7uqPuxLEtzus5m7PBg5CeqH4%3D&shp=a5d48078&shcp=2c5759a5\"\n        },\n        \"creator_user_id\": \"7400230764149244970\",\n        \"permissions\": [\n            \"LIVE_STREAM_PERMISSION\",\n            \"ADD_AFFILIATE_PERMISSION\"\n        ],\n        \"register_region\": \"US\",\n        \"selection_region\": \"US\",\n        \"seller_type\": \"UNKNOWN\",\n        \"user_type\": \"TIKTOK_SHOP_CREATOR\",\n        \"username\": \"testdziwjtmwbq\"\n    },\n    \"message\": \"Success\",\n    \"request_id\": \"202408081837124EF0047357C9480005DB\"\n}\n```\n\n\n* [Call the Create Target Collaboration API](create-target-collaboration):\n\n```curl\ncurl --location --globoff 'https://open-api.tiktokglobalshop.com/affiliate_seller/202405/target_collaborations?app_key=6d0ut2ttps2io&shop_cipher=TTP_bCWokAAAAAA6xm9rY_B9wYFY2QltXcs9&sign=5ddb3f519b3da61f2f959df81fc42b77441df06626f070ae423e3112a932111a&timestamp=1723144047' \\\n--header 'content-type: application/json' \\\n--header 'x-tts-access-token: <redacted>' \\\n--data-raw '{\n    \"name\": \"API Target Collaboration\",\n    \"message\": \"Created via Postman\",\n    \"end_time\": \"1723194000\",\n    \"products\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"1729569362021748922\",\n            \"target_commission_rate\": 2001\n        }\n    ],\n    \"creator_user_ids\": [\n        \"7400230764149244970\"\n    ],\n    \"seller_contact_info\": {\n        \"email\": \"test@tiktokshop.com\"\n    },\n    \"free_sample_rule\": {\n        \"has_free_sample\": true,\n        \"is_sample_approval_exempt\": false\n    }\n}'\n\n{\n    \"code\": 0,\n    \"data\": {\n        \"target_collaboration\": {\n            \"id\": \"7400846837790361387\"\n        },\n        \"target_collaboration_conflicts\": []\n    },\n    \"message\": \"Success\",\n    \"request_id\": \"202408081907271D8F70256ABB65008443\"\n}\n```\n\n\n* It is recommended that the `end_time` be at least a few days from now.\n* Sometimes the API may return `target_collaboration_conflicts` in the response.

This prompt will also let the creator order a free sample if it is enabled in the open collaboration, or prompt them to make a shoppable video if it is a targeted collaboration.\n### Partner/seller using API\nTo call any of the APIs listed under **Affiliate Creator** in the API Reference, you will need to have your creator authorize your application. Follow the [Creator Authorization flow in the link here](creator-authorization-guide). The following steps assume you have a token to make changes to their TikTok account. For testing purposes, you may use the TikTok Creator Account credentials above if you do not currently have one.\n\n\nTo add a product to a creator's showcase, the product must already exist as part of a collaboration. You may get an error that asks you to contact TikTok if a product collaboration link does not exist. See above on how to create a targeted collaboration.\n\n\nTo add a product to the creator's showcase, you can call the [Add Showcase Products API](add-showcase-products). It is recommended that you add the affiliate link that can be generated as per the use case above.\n\n\nOnce the product is added to their showcase, they can request free samples if enabled.\n### Creator using API\nThe application integrating with TikTok APIs can show the current products listed in a particular creator's account by calling Get Showcase Products.\n## Free samples for creators\n### Enabling free samples\nFree samples can only be enabled in the Affiliate Center. Click on **Not Created** to open a modal that lets you specify rules for free samples. The only required field is quantity, you can tweak the rest to your liking. Once free samples are enabled, you need to generate a product promotion link that can be shared with creators.\n\n\nPlease refer to the above sections: **Generate affiliate product promotion link**, **Creating an open collaboration**, and **Creating a targeted collaboration** on how to generate the link where creators can request samples.\n\n\n<span style=\"color: orange\">📌 </span><span style=\"color: orange\"><strong>Note</strong></span><span style=\"color: orange\">: If a product is not added to open collaboration, only the link is generated.</span>\n\n\nShare this link with a creator so they can add it to showcase as shown below.\n### Requesting free samples\n|  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![Image](https://sf16-sg.tiktokcdn.com/obj/eden-sg/jvK_ylwvslclK_JWZ%5B%5B/ljhwZthlaukjlkulzlp/Developer_Guide/Affiliate%20Integration/free_sample1.png?x-resource-account=public) <br>  | ![Image](https://sf16-sg.tiktokcdn.com/obj/eden-sg/jvK_ylwvslclK_JWZ%5B%5B/ljhwZthlaukjlkulzlp/Developer_Guide/Affiliate%20Integration/free_sample2.png?x-resource-account=public) <br>  | ![Image](https://sf16-sg.tiktokcdn.com/obj/eden-sg/jvK_ylwvslclK_JWZ%5B%5B/ljhwZthlaukjlkulzlp/Developer_Guide/Affiliate%20Integration/free_sample3.png?x-resource-account=public) <br>  | ![Image](https://sf16-sg.tiktokcdn.com/obj/eden-sg/jvK_ylwvslclK_JWZ%5B%5B/ljhwZthlaukjlkulzlp/Developer_Guide/Affiliate%20Integration/free_sample4.png?x-resource-account=public) <br>  | ![Image](https://sf16-sg.tiktokcdn.com/obj/eden-sg/jvK_ylwvslclK_JWZ%5B%5B/ljhwZthlaukjlkulzlp/Developer_Guide/Affiliate%20Integration/free_sample5.png?x-resource-account=public) <br>  |\n\n### Fulfilling free samples\nWhen a creator adds a product to their showcase, they also have the option to request a free sample if available. Requests for these samples are displayed in Affiliate Center under the [Sample Requests page](https://affiliate-us.tiktok.com/product/sample-request?shop_region=US). Sellers can approve or deny these requests if auto-approved is set to false.\n\n\nOnce approved, a sample order is created and should be reflected in Seller Center.
