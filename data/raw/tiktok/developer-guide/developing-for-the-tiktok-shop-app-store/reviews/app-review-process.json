A public app must undergo both app review and language listing review before it can be published on the App & Service Market.\n   **Note**: For the \"Connector\" category targeting the US/UK sellers, an additional Beta testing review is required before an app can be published.\n2. Most custom apps are not required to be reviewed from the platform before publishing. Review is **required** for custom apps that fall under the \"Connector\" category and/or those that have reached 25 or more seller authorizations.\n\n![Image](https://p16-arcosite-va.ibyteimg.com/tos-maliva-i-10qhjjqwgv-us/f0295b6562424729a0d0ac0bce4c3325~tplv-10qhjjqwgv-image.image)\nThe flowchart above outlines the process of submitting an app for review, with each TTS review node highlighted in pink.\n## App Design\nDuring this stage, the reviewer assesses whether the submitted ARD (App Requirement Document) meets the essential functionalities of TikTok Shop.\n## App Development and Review\nDuring this stage, the reviewer will review and test your app.\n### Public App\nThe public app should follow and implement the features and use cases outlined in our latest App Requirement Document (ARD) Guide for its respective category. The public app must fully and effectively execute all the features and use cases specified in the App Requirement Document.\n### Custom App\nCustom apps do not require a review from platform before publishing, with the exception of \"Connector\" apps, or those that have reached 25 or more seller authorizations. Additionally, custom apps are not visible on the App & Service Store.\n## App Launch\nDuring this stage, the reviewer will look at the language listings for app details page on App & Service Store and review performance from beta testing.\n\n1. **Language Listing review:** ensures that the app information displayed on the App & Service Store about the app is accurate.\n2. **Beta Testing:** This phase evaluates the app's performance and ensures there are no bugs that could impact the sellers' experience.\n\n### Public App\nLanguage listing review is required for all public apps. Currently, only the 'Connectors' category targeting the US/UK market triggers this stage. During Beta testing, public apps will not be visible on the App & Service Store. Both public and custom apps allow a maximum of 10 authorizations. Once all reviews are successfully completed and approved, all limitations will be lifted. Developers can then publish the public app on the App & Service Store and receive authorizations from merchants.\n### Custom App\nLanguage listing review is not required for custom apps. However, the \"Connector\" category targeting the US/UK sellers needs to pass beta testing review before publishing the app. During beta testing, both public and custom apps allow a maximum of 10 authorizations. Once all reviews are successfully completed and approved, all limitations will be lifted.\n# Review process for seller developer\nIf you are building a custom app accessing your shop's data, app review and language listing is not required.\n\n",
