Compared with the B2C e-commerce scenario, the role of the partners is \"service seller\" and the role of the e-commerce seller is \"service buyer\".\n* **Tokopedia & Shop App Store**:\n   * **For partners**: The Public App will be published in the Tokopedia & Shop App Store. Sellers can browse and authorize the App(s) created by ISV or 3rd-party developers in the App Store.\n   * **For sellers**: To help sellers boost business on Tokopedia & Shop and improve your operational efficiency, Tokopedia & Shop now offers an App Store where sellers can contact and authorize App(s) that suit sellers to improve productivity, and synchronize products.\n\n| **Seller Market** | **App Store Portal** | **Tokopedia & Shop Seller Center - App Store** |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **Indonesia local seller** | [https://seller-id.tokopedia.com/appstore/id](https://seller-id.tokopedia.com/appstore/id) | [https://seller-id.tokopedia.com/services/market?shop_region=ID](https://seller-id.tokopedia.com/services/market?shop_region=ID) |\n# Case 1: If you have integrated with「Tokopedia Open Platform」and「Tokopedia & Shop Partner Center」before\n> Tokopedia Open Platform: https://developer.tokopedia.com/\n> Tokopedia & Shop Partner Center: https://partner.tiktokshop.com/\n\n## Step 1: Login「Tokopedia & Shop Partner Center」\n> 📌 Access to Tokopedia & Shop website: **https://partner.tiktokshop.com/**\n\n<br>\n\n## Step 2: Bind「Tokopedia Open Platform」account and「Tokopedia & Shop Partner Center」account\n### 2.1 Find the Organization ID in Tokopedia Open Platform <span id=\"case1_step2\"></span> \n\n1. Go to [Tokopedia dev portal](https://developer.tokopedia.com/console). Once logged in, you will be directed to the main dashboard of the developer console.\n2. Identify Organization ID: Look at the top left corner of the dashboard, below your company's name, you will see the Organization ID\n\n<div style=\"text-align: center\"><img src=\"https://sf16-sg.tiktokcdn.com/obj/eden-sg/jvK_ylwvslclK_JWZ[[/ljhwZthlaukjlkulzlp/Developer_Guide/Get_Started/ISV_Onboardling_Toko/image04.png\" width=\"2852px\" /></div>\n\n### 2.2 Bind account\n> 📌 By binding the accounts, you no longer need to create multiple applications. This not only saves your time and resources but also reduces complexity. In the future, you will be able to maintain merchants from both platforms under a single application, which will significantly streamline your shop operation.\n\nUse the Organization ID from Tokopedia Open Platform and input it into the「Tokopedia & Shop Partner Center」.\n| **#** <!-- width:70px --> | **Operation** | **Demo** <!-- width:250px --> |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Step 1 | 1. Click \"[My Account - Link Tokopedia Account](https://partner.tiktokshop.com/approval/toko)\" <br> 2. If you already have Tokopedia & Shop App, you can see the entrance in the App Management page <br>  | ![Image](https://sf16-sg.tiktokcdn.com/obj/eden-sg/jvK_ylwvslclK_JWZ%5B%5B/ljhwZthlaukjlkulzlp/Developer_Guide/Get_Started/ISV_Onboardling_Toko/image05.png) <br> ![Image](https://sf16-sg.tiktokcdn.com/obj/eden-sg/jvK_ylwvslclK_JWZ%5B%5B/ljhwZthlaukjlkulzlp/Developer_Guide/Get_Started/ISV_Onboardling_Toko/image06.png) <br>  |\n| Step 2 | Click \"Link now\" and enter Tokopedia organization ID and Registered email in Tokopedia Open Platform <br> 📌 One「Tokopedia & Shop Partner Center」account can only be bound to one 「Tokopedia Open Platform」account, establishing a 1:1 mapping relationship. | ![Image](https://sf16-sg.tiktokcdn.com/obj/eden-sg/jvK_ylwvslclK_JWZ%5B%5B/ljhwZthlaukjlkulzlp/Developer_Guide/Get_Started/ISV_Onboardling_Toko/image07.png) <br>  |\n<br>\n\n## Step 3: Bind Tokopedia App and \"Tokopedia & Shop\" App <span id=\"case1_step3\"></span> \n> 📌 After binding the App key, you will be able to query valuable information. For example, you can find out how many Tokopedia merchants have migrated to TTS and how many merchants have completed App authorization. This data will be very useful for you to better understand the market situation and plan your business strategies accordingly.\n\n### 3.1 Find App ID in Tokopedia Open Platform\nGo back to the Tokopedia Developer Portal to locate the **App ID** for the application you have integrated\n### 3.2 Bind App\n| **#** <!-- width:70px --> | **Operation** | **Demo** <!-- width:250px --> |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Step 1 | When you finish the account binding, you will enter the App binding page automatically. <br> You can also click \"[My Account - Link Tokopedia Account](https://partner.tiktokshop.com/approval/toko)\" to bind the Tokopedia App and \"Tokopedia & Shop\" App. | ![Image](https://sf16-sg.tiktokcdn.com/obj/eden-sg/jvK_ylwvslclK_JWZ%5B%5B/ljhwZthlaukjlkulzlp/Developer_Guide/Get_Started/ISV_Onboardling_Toko/image08.jpeg) <br> ![Image](https://sf16-sg.tiktokcdn.com/obj/eden-sg/jvK_ylwvslclK_JWZ%5B%5B/ljhwZthlaukjlkulzlp/Developer_Guide/Get_Started/ISV_Onboardling_Toko/image09.png) <br>  |\n| Step 2 | Choose \"Tokopedia & Shop\" App and Tokopedia App which you want to bind. <br>  <br> 📌Please note that: <br> 1. One \"Tokopedia & Shop\" Appkey can bind to multiple Tokopedia App IDs, but one Tokopedia App ID cannot be bound to multiple \"Tokopedia & Shop\" Appkeys. <br> 2. The status of \"Tokopedia & Shop\" App should be online | ![Image](https://sf16-sg.tiktokcdn.com/obj/eden-sg/jvK_ylwvslclK_JWZ%5B%5B/ljhwZthlaukjlkulzlp/Developer_Guide/Get_Started/ISV_Onboardling_Toko/image10.png) <br>  |\n<br>\n\n## Step 4: Integrate with Tokopedia & Shop API <span id=\"case1_step4\"></span> \n\n* By integrating with the new API, only one merchant portal (Tokopedia & Shop Seller Center) and one set of Open APIs (TikTok Shop APIs) will be available\n* Both user Apps — Tokopedia and Shop｜Tokopedia — will remain available\n* Merchants can choose to sell products on one of these apps or both simultaneously. ISVs must use the Shop｜Tokopedia APIs to manage merchant operations on both apps. Once the merchant migration is complete, all newly generated data can only be accessed through the Shop｜Tokopedia APIs. Some historical data (such as merchant data) will be migrated to Shop｜Tokopedia, while other historical data (such as orders and bills) will remain in Tokopedia.\n\n**Please** [click here to access to the API onepager](id-market-tokopedia-shop-open-api-integration-one-pager) **to view more about:**\n\n1. **Data access via APIs**: What APIs to use to access new data and integrate historical data of merchants migrating from Tokopedia to \"Tokopedia & Shop\"?\n2. **Changes to Shop｜Tokopedia APIs**: What changes are made in Shop｜Tokopedia APIs to suit the Indonesian market?\n3. **Mapping of shops and products**: How will the new shops and products from \"Tokopedia & Shop\" be mapped to those from Tokopedia?\n\n<br>\n\n## Step 5: Test your App and Publish <span id=\"case1_step5\"></span> \n\n1.

Each App type has its own workflows and requirements. <br>  <br> * **Public App:** This type of App is publicly listed on the [Tokopedia & Shop App Store](https://seller-id.tokopedia.com/appstore/id) and is discoverable by sellers. Sellers will authorize the App to connect their Tokopedia & Shop account. To list this App on [Tokopedia & Shop App Store](https://seller-id.tokopedia.com/appstore/id), the App must pass Tokopedia & Shop's App review process. <br> * **Custom App:** This type of App is typically developed for a particular seller. It is tailored to meet the specific business needs, requirements, or preferences of a seller. The App is not listed on Tokopedia & Shop App Store. You can distribute this App to individual sellers by sharing the App's authorization link. <br>  <br> 📌 **Note:** Partner Center supports the ability to convert/upgrade a custom App to a public app. Refer to [Publishing a custom App](publish-custom-app) for more information on how to convert your published custom App. | ![Image](https://sf16-sg.tiktokcdn.com/obj/eden-sg/jvK_ylwvslclK_JWZ%5B%5B/ljhwZthlaukjlkulzlp/Developer_Guide/Get_Started/ISV_Onboardling_Toko/image26.png) |\n| 2 | **Create your App** <br>  <br> 1.

Sellers can browse and authorize the App(s) in the App Store.\n* For Custom Apps: Custom App is typically developed for a particular seller. It is tailored to meet the specific business needs, requirements, or preferences of a seller. The App is not listed on Tokopedia & Shop App Store. You can distribute this App to individual sellers by sharing the App's authorization link.\n\n### For Public App\nAfter you complete and submit the app review and language listing forms, and ensure you've passed the compliance review, you have finished all the steps necessary to publish and list your public app.\nYou can check the publishing status of your app on the app and service detail page.\n\n* If Tokopedia & Shop approves your app, we will automatically make it available on the App and Service Store for sellers to authorize. In addition, we will provide you with an \"Authorize link\" you can copy and share with sellers individually.\n* If Tokopedia & Shop rejects your app, click **Edit** to view our reasoning, make adjustments, and resubmit your app for further review.\n\n### For Custom App\nAfter you complete registration and integration, you have finished all the steps necessary to publish your custom app. Please click 「Publish」and then the App will be published automatically.\n![Image](https://sf16-sg.tiktokcdn.com/obj/eden-sg/jvK_ylwvslclK_JWZ%5B%5B/ljhwZthlaukjlkulzlp/Developer_Guide/Get_Started/ISV_Onboardling_Toko/image53.png)\n<br>\n\n## Step 10: Authorized by seller\n### For Public App\nThere are two ways for sellers to authorize your App.\n\n1. Sellers browse and authorize the App in the App Store\n\nSellers can go to [[Seller Center] > [Apps store]](https://seller-id.tokopedia.com/services/market) and finish the authorization.\n![Image](https://sf16-sg.tiktokcdn.com/obj/eden-sg/jvK_ylwvslclK_JWZ%5B%5B/ljhwZthlaukjlkulzlp/Developer_Guide/Get_Started/ISV_Onboardling_Toko/image54.png)\n![Image](https://sf16-sg.tiktokcdn.com/obj/eden-sg/jvK_ylwvslclK_JWZ%5B%5B/ljhwZthlaukjlkulzlp/Developer_Guide/Get_Started/ISV_Onboardling_Toko/image55.png)\n![Image](https://sf16-sg.tiktokcdn.com/obj/eden-sg/jvK_ylwvslclK_JWZ%5B%5B/ljhwZthlaukjlkulzlp/Developer_Guide/Get_Started/ISV_Onboardling_Toko/image56.png)\n![Image](https://sf16-sg.tiktokcdn.com/obj/eden-sg/jvK_ylwvslclK_JWZ%5B%5B/ljhwZthlaukjlkulzlp/Developer_Guide/Get_Started/ISV_Onboardling_Toko/image57.png)\n\n2.

Can I convert my custom app to a public app\nIf you determine that your published custom app can offer value to sellers outside your app's original seller scope, Partner Center offers the ability to convert your custom app to a public app. This allows you to make your app available on the [Tokopedia & Shop App Store](https://seller-id.tokopedia.com/appstore/id).\nFor a published custom app, you can click **Upgrade to Public Service** to convert your app from custom to public. Please note this is a beta feature on a gray test, and you may not see the button if you are not on the test invite list.\n**Important:**\n\n* You can't upgrade a custom App to public if you have not published the app yet.\n* You can't change the target sellers (i.e. the market and seller type) when converting the app type from custom to public.\n* You'll need to fill in all language listings before you can submit the custom app for upgrade review.\n* The app type will remain custom until the app passes the upgrade review and reviews for all selected markets.\n\n![Image](https://sf16-sg.tiktokcdn.com/obj/eden-sg/jvK_ylwvslclK_JWZ%5B%5B/ljhwZthlaukjlkulzlp/Developer_Guide/Get_Started/ISV_Onboardling_Toko/image59.png)\n<br>\n\n## 2.
