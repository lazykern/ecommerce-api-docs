  "content": "# Overview\n\n* Are you concerned about the emergence of the following problems during the migration process?\n   * Whether you should proceed to call the Tokopedia API to fetch orders.\n   * Whether merchants might duplicate shipments.\n* To assist Tokopedia developers in providing enhanced services to sellers and guaranteeing a smooth transition of diverse business operations during the merchant migration phase, the \"Tokopedia & Shop Partner Center\" has introduced a novel function named \"**Migration Rehearsal**\". This functionality empowers developers to proactively foresee the performance of normal API call returns on both the Tokopedia platform and the Tokopedia & Shop platform throughout each stage of integrating the Tokopedia stores under their purview with Tokopedia & Shop shops, which encompasses the pre-integration, integration-in-progress, and post-integration periods.\n* It is essential that developers leverage this feature comprehensively to authenticate and optimize their own systems.\n* 📌 Given the restricted quantity of test shops available on the platform and the irreversible characteristic of the integration process, each developer is entitled to a **maximum of five opportunities** for shop integration rehearsals. It is recommended that developers, in advance, adhere to the instructions provided in the [Changelog](id-market-tokopedia-shop-open-api-integration-one-pager) and [Tokopedia & Shop - ISV & Seller developer onboarding](tokopedia-shop-isv-seller-developer-onboarding) to finalize the development and deploy it into the test environment. Subsequently, this function should be employed for the purposes of testing and verification.\n\n# Rehearsal Guide\n## Rehearsal Process\n![Image](https://sf16-sg.tiktokcdn.com/obj/eden-sg/jvK_ylwvslclK_JWZ%5B%5B/ljhwZthlaukjlkulzlp/Developer_Guide/Get_Started/Toko_migration_rehearsal/image1.jpeg)\n## Preparation\n> Tokopedia Open Platform: https://developer.tokopedia.com/\n> Tokopedia & Shop Partner Center: https://partner.tiktokshop.com/\n\n\n1. The developer is required to possess a Tokopedia Developer account.\n2. There should be at least one test App in the Tokopedia Developer account.\n   ![Image](https://sf16-sg.tiktokcdn.com/obj/eden-sg/jvK_ylwvslclK_JWZ%5B%5B/ljhwZthlaukjlkulzlp/Developer_Guide/Get_Started/Toko_migration_rehearsal/image2.png)\n3. The developer should subscribe to the \"merge\" event for their Tokopedia test App according to the instructions in the \"Registering a Webhook with Tokopedia\" section of the [[Changelog](id-market-tokopedia-shop-open-api-integration-one-pager#How%20to%20check%20shop%20migration%20status?:~:text=about%20any%20changes.-,Registering,-a%20Webhook%20with)].\n4. The developer should ensure that none of the test shops under their test App have the following options enabled.\n   ![Image](https://sf16-sg.tiktokcdn.com/obj/eden-sg/jvK_ylwvslclK_JWZ%5B%5B/ljhwZthlaukjlkulzlp/Developer_Guide/Get_Started/Toko_migration_rehearsal/image3.png)\n5. The target market of Tokopedia & Shop App has already included Indonesia.\n6. The developer has already bound their Tokopedia & Shop Partner Center account with the Tokopedia Open Platform account.\n   ![Image](https://sf16-sg.tiktokcdn.com/obj/eden-sg/jvK_ylwvslclK_JWZ%5B%5B/ljhwZthlaukjlkulzlp/Developer_Guide/Get_Started/Toko_migration_rehearsal/image4.png)\n7. The developer should have newly created at least one development shop in Indonesia.\n   ![Image](https://sf16-sg.tiktokcdn.com/obj/eden-sg/jvK_ylwvslclK_JWZ%5B%5B/ljhwZthlaukjlkulzlp/Developer_Guide/Get_Started/Toko_migration_rehearsal/image5.png)\n8. The developer should have adapted to the new version of API in the Indonesian market according to the [[Changelog](id-market-tokopedia-shop-open-api-integration-one-pager)] and the corresponding API documentation.\n9. The developer should have tested the business process of their system in the development shop in Indonesia according to the \"Step 5: Test your App and Publish\" in [Tokopedia & Shop - ISV & Seller developer onboarding](tokopedia-shop-isv-seller-developer-onboarding).\n\n## Start to Rehearse\n\n1. Enter [Tokopedia & Shop Partner Center - Development Shops.](https://partner.tiktokshop.com/v2_sandbox/config?activeTab=manage_account&region=ID)\n2. Select a Development Shop with \"Indonesia\" as the Target market.\n   ![Image](https://sf16-sg.tiktokcdn.com/obj/eden-sg/jvK_ylwvslclK_JWZ%5B%5B/ljhwZthlaukjlkulzlp/Developer_Guide/Get_Started/Toko_migration_rehearsal/image6.png)\n3.

Select the test app corresponding to the Tokopedia test shop that you want to bind.\n   ![Image](https://sf16-sg.tiktokcdn.com/obj/eden-sg/jvK_ylwvslclK_JWZ%5B%5B/ljhwZthlaukjlkulzlp/Developer_Guide/Get_Started/Toko_migration_rehearsal/image8.png)\n   ![Image](https://sf16-sg.tiktokcdn.com/obj/eden-sg/jvK_ylwvslclK_JWZ%5B%5B/ljhwZthlaukjlkulzlp/Developer_Guide/Get_Started/Toko_migration_rehearsal/image9.png)\n6. Click on \"Confirm\".\n\n## Verification\n\n* When everything is in proper order, the Tokopedia test shop will attempt integration with the Tokopedia & Shop Development Shop.\n   * Please be aware that this integration process is irreversible and unbinding after integration is not an option.\n   * The process may last from a few hours to a full day.\n* During migration, developers must cover the following scenarios at least:\n   * For Tokopedia & Shop Test Shop:\n      * Product Modification Testing: The price and inventory of products in the Tokopedia & Shop Development Shop can be altered using the Tokopedia & Shop Products API. Other information cannot be modified and new product additions are not possible.\n      * Order Fulfillment Testing: A virtual order can be created in the Tokopedia & Shop Development Shop and retrieved via the Tokopedia & Shop Orders API. The fulfillment can be simulated through the Tokopedia & Shop Fulfillment API.\n   * For the Tokopedia test shop:\n      * Product Modification Testing: The price and inventory of products in the Tokopedia test shop can be changed via the Tokopedia Product API. Other details cannot be modified and new product additions are prohibited.\n      * Order Fulfillment Testing: A virtual order can be made on the Tokopedia consumer end with a test buyer account. The order can be fetched through the Tokopedia Order API and the fulfillment simulated via the Tokopedia Orders API.\n   * **Once the developer receives the \"merge\" webhook sent by the Tokopedia gateway on the server, it indicates a successful integration.**\n   * **After the shop merges:**\n      ![Image](https://sf16-sg.tiktokcdn.com/obj/eden-sg/jvK_ylwvslclK_JWZ%5B%5B/ljhwZthlaukjlkulzlp/Developer_Guide/Get_Started/Toko_migration_rehearsal/image10.jpeg)\n      * Developers can immediately use the Order API to obtain orders and fulfillment. However, **APIs related to product listing and product modifying can only be successfully called after merchants manually confirm the \"product merge\"**.\n      * Developers should:\n         * Test whether the **tts_seller_id and shop_id(toko_shop_id)** obtained from the [Tokopedia Get Shop Info API](https://developer.tokopedia.com/openapi/guide/api-reference/tokopedia/shop-api/get-shop-info/) are consistent with the **tts_seller_id and shop_id(toko_shop_id)** in the webhook.\n         * Test whether it is possible to obtain the product id of the original Tokopedia products on the Tokopedia & Shop side through the **Tokopedia Get Product Info API**.\n         * Thoroughly test the use of the **Tokopedia & Shop Product API** for subsequent product management tasks (including price and inventory changes, description modifications, product launches, and listing and delisting on both platforms).\n         * Use a Tokopedia buyer account to create a virtual order. Then, retrieve the order via the **Tokopedia & Shop Orders API** and simulate the fulfillment via the TTS Fulfillment API.\n         * Use a Tokopedia buyer account to start a customer service conversation. Then, retrieve the conversation via the **Tokopedia & Shop Customer Service API** and test various message types.\n      * Developers should confirm \"Product Merge\" in seller center, before testing any **Tokopedia & Shop Product API:**\n         ![Image](https://sf16-sg.tiktokcdn.com/obj/eden-sg/jvK_ylwvslclK_JWZ%5B%5B/ljhwZthlaukjlkulzlp/Developer_Guide/Get_Started/Toko_migration_rehearsal/image11.png)\n\n<br>\n\n# FAQ\n## 1.
