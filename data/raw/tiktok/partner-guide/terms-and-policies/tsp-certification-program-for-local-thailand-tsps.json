You will receive a registration form.\nTo register, you must manage at least 3 sellers on TikTok Shop.\nFor shop management category, please only include the shop if you provide order fulfillment services.\nFor content management category, please fill in all official/marketing creator accounts bound to each seller account.\nYou must update us through your account manager when shops you manage change or when the category of service changes, using the same form.\n# **FAQs**\n\n1. **Can I participate in the certification program if I only provide content management or shop management services?**\n\nYes, you will still earn points under the content management or shop management categories and be eligible for the awards in that category.\n\n2. **What happens if I make a false declaration of the shops I manage?**\n\nYou may be excluded from the program and/or forfeit any previous awards received. Shops without a valid record of an authorized relationship between seller and TSP on Partner Center will not be counted toward score computation.\n\n3. **Is it compulsory to join the program?**\n\nIt is not compulsory, but we encourage all TSPs who are eligible to join the program.\n\n4. **If you bind/unbind with sellers midway through the quarter, how will this be reflected in the score?**\n\nPlease update us through your AM when shops you manage change or when the category of service changes. The scoring will be based on the list of shops that you manage and bind during the period.\n\n5. **Will appeals against violations be reflected in the score?**\n\nWe will generate the score on a monthly basis. If appeals are successful and the violation points are revoked before the generation date, they will be reflected in the score.\n\n6. **How will I receive updates on my performance?**\n\nAn aggregated report with your performance will be sent via email on a monthly basis.\n\n7. **Is there a way to appeal the award given?**\n\nThe award given is final and at TikTok Shop’s discretion. If you have any questions or suggestions, please contact your AM for further support.\n\n8. **If a seller collaborates with multiple agencies, how is the score calculated?**\n\nThe score will be attributed to the agency that registers the seller/handle in the form, aligning with the binding data in the system. Each agency can receive the score for one seller/handle at a time.\n\n",
