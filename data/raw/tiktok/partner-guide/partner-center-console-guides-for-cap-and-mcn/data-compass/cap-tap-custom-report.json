It enables agencies to select relevant metrics, adjust timeframes, and apply filters to refine reporting results, providing clearer data visualization. Reports can be exported to Excel as well for deeper analysis, supporting long-term creator management strategies.\nAs the Custom Report continues to evolve, four new features have been introduced in Dec 2024: Time Comparison, Summary, Trend Charts and additional filters, enabling lightweight analysis capabilities for Agencies.\n![Image](https://p16-arcosite-va.ibyteimg.com/tos-maliva-i-10qhjjqwgv-us/8be96f4f7eec4ace87a61c68a315a359~tplv-10qhjjqwgv-image.image)\n# **Benefits of Custom Report for Agency Partners**\n\n1. **Enables customization of data and reporting needs:** Customize filters and dimensions to fulfill key data analysis needs, such as getting hot product lists for specific campaigns and examining overall performance across campaigns.\n2. **Improves efficiency:** Streamlines the process so campaign data can be easily viewed, exported and analyzed all in one place.\n3. **Offers enhanced Insights**: Exporting enables further analysis and manipulation of data within Excel, empowering you to delve deeper into insights, leading to more informed decision-making and strategic planning.\n4. **Provides ready access to past reports**: Users have easy access to reports along with dimensions and filter configurations) generated in the past and can download them again.\n\n![Image](https://p16-arcosite-va.ibyteimg.com/tos-maliva-i-10qhjjqwgv-us/31f1684c47bb405094ba8ad7fcfd92fb~tplv-10qhjjqwgv-image.image)\n# **Use cases for Custom Report**\n## New Use Cases Enabled by Latest Features\n### [NEW] Use Case 1: Quickly access the trend chart of Affiliate GMV for a specific creator\n\n* Select creator dimension, input creator's handle in the creator filter, then click the \"**Search**\" button.\n* Navigate to the \"Trend chart\" tab., select \"**Affiliate GMV**\" metric to view its trend chart.\n* To compare Affiliate GMV trends across multiple creators, you can clear the creator handle in the initial filter and **input multiple creator handles** in the filter on the **Trend Chart** tab.\n\n### [NEW] Use Case 2: Track campaign progress and compare performance across periods\n\n* Select the Campaign dimension and choose \"**All Time**\" for the date range; then enable the **Comparison checkbox**, and select the desired comparison metrics, and click \"**Search**\" to generate results.\n* View comparison rates for all selected numeric metrics in the \"Table\" tab, displayed in red/green below the raw data values to indicate increases/decreases.\n* Select \"**Summary**\" near the Export button to quickly access the rough proportion of each campaign.\n* Click the \"**Export\"** button to download the raw data, comparison rates, and summary data together.\n\n## Salient use cases for Agency partners\nThe following use cases are not exhaustive and only highlight key analytics use cases and metrics that Agencies can use as part of their creator management operations.\n### Use Case 1: View creator management analytics at different timeframe ranges\n\n* You can use the **Time dimension** to group key metrics in terms of the time range that meets your analytics needs. You can choose to use **Daily** level aggregation for in-depth analytics of Creator management and use **Monthly** aggregation to view long-term trends, Creator performance/growth and overall reporting purposes.\n\n### Use Case 2: Check product lists or categories of products\n\n* You can use the relevant **Dimensions** setting to select **Product** and **Product Category.** These can include but are not limited to product specific GMV, product level engagement and impressions etc. Add the **Creator** dimension to view how fruitful Creators/Product combinations are.\n* Next, you can use the **Filters option** to add in your date range and the specific list of **Creators and Shops** that have promoted the product. Once you click on Search, you will be given the list of all products for the campaigns that meet your filter options.\n\n### Use Case 3: Understand Creator performance to maximize ROI\n\n* You can use the relevant **Dimensions** setting to select Creator specific metrics such as GMV, Orders etc.\n* Next, you can use the **Filters option** to **add the specific Creator IDs** for whom you want to see results.

If an agency provides TSP or MCN/CAP services as well as the TAP services, they will need to change their service category to MCN/CAP to be able to view metrics for CAP related data.\n   1. *For example*: If an agency is registered as a TAP and MCN/CAP in US region, they must choose between TAP and MCN/CAP service categories to be able to view the relevant data\n2. The region in Custom Report will not automatically be the same as the region selected on other tabs of the Analytics section.\n   1. *For example*: An agency is registered as an ++MCN/CAP++ in both MY and ID. While viewing data in the Video Analytics tab, they switch their region from ID to MY. However, when they open the Custom Report tab, the region will revert back to ID instead of remaining consistent with the region they were viewing in the Video Analytics tab.\n\n## **Using Dimensions**\nDimensions are logical groupings of important and relevant metrics. Within the Dimensions section, you can select a number of different dimensions. Dimensions correspond to the headings displayed in your search results.\n\n1. **Time Dimension** — Here, you can select from **one of the below.** Select a particular **time dimension** to aggregate results by the selected dimension range.\n   1. By Day\n   2. By Week (starting on Monday)\n   3. By Month\n   4. All Time (is selected by default in the time dimension)\n\n<div style=\"text-align: center\"><img src=\"https://p16-arcosite-va.ibyteimg.com/tos-maliva-i-10qhjjqwgv-us/02066ca79d2d4cba957f5baadd07bb12~tplv-10qhjjqwgv-image.image\" width=\"2216px\" /></div>\n\n\n2. **Other Dimensions** — you can **multi-select** any of the below. The only exception is that LIVE and Video cannot be selected together.\n\nNote: When you select each dimension, **all the types associated with that dimension** are automatically selected. All associated metrics will also be displayed in the grid view.\nAt a later time, users will also be able to select individual metrics within the selected dimensions to have an even more relevant view of the metrics of interest.\n| At present, the following dimensions will be available for authorized CAP users. | The following dimensions will be available for TAP users. |\n| --- | --- |\n| 1. Creator <br> 2. LIVE <br> 3. Video <br> 4. Product <br> 5. Shop <br> 6. Product Category | 1. Campaign <br> 2. Creator <br> 3. LIVE <br> 4. Video <br> 5. Product <br> 6. Shop <br> 7. Product Category |\n*After selection of the required dimensions, the number of associated underlying metrics will be displayed and will dynamically change as the selected dimension combination changes.*\n<div style=\"text-align: center\"><img src=\"https://p16-arcosite-va.ibyteimg.com/tos-maliva-i-10qhjjqwgv-us/d452a2b617a44158ba457dc5398b4674~tplv-10qhjjqwgv-image.image\" width=\"2227px\" /></div>\n\n## **Using Filters**\nFilters can help you better refine search results. You can select from the time filter as well as the categories, as detailed below.\n\n1. **Time** — both fixed and dynamic time periods are supported, with the oldest date option 6 months in the past.\n   1. **Fixed Date Range:** Select your desired date range by one or multiple days /week/month in the calendar box. Recent 6 month data is available.\n   2. **Dynamic Date Range:** Select from one of the following:\n      1. Last 7 days\n      2. Last 28 days\n   3. **Time comparison** — this checkbox is available when the \"**All time**\" dimension is selected.\n      1. The tool provides a default time comparison range, and you can customize it to any period within the last 6 months and before the base time range you select.\n      2. Comparison data is displayed below the raw data in red/green to indicate increases/decreases. This data can also be exported as an Excel file.\n\n![Image](https://p16-arcosite-va.ibyteimg.com/tos-maliva-i-10qhjjqwgv-us/19a0573364844360b8f6a72c809ff0a0~tplv-10qhjjqwgv-image.image)\n\n2. **Creator Handle Name, Product ID, Shop ID filters, LIVE Room ID, Video ID, Product Category** — for each of these 6 filters supports accurate search as well as batch input. With batch input, you can separate each item by a comma and input a maximum of 500 items per filter.\n   1. You can select whether you want to **Include or Exclude** the items you have pasted for each filter.\n   2. This section is useful as it allows you to refine your results so that the data displayed will only be for the items you have added into the filters and is catered to what you need to analyze.\n   3. For Product category, you can choose to filter by whether Level 1 product category or Level 2 product category.\n\n<div style=\"text-align: center\"><img src=\"https://p16-arcosite-va.ibyteimg.com/tos-maliva-i-10qhjjqwgv-us/a429c9376bdc4759b0c0376225ebb2cb~tplv-10qhjjqwgv-image.image\" width=\"2169px\" /></div>\n\n<div style=\"text-align: center\"><img src=\"https://p16-arcosite-va.ibyteimg.com/tos-maliva-i-10qhjjqwgv-us/a760ec9bb9614ce1be9a6081fdfbbaa4~tplv-10qhjjqwgv-image.image\" width=\"1410px\" /></div>\n\n## Viewing data in table and trend\n\n1.
