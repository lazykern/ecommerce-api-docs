The actual interface and features may differ.)\n# Data Function Introduction：\nWe have introduced a new Content Type Based GMV Attribution where GMV will be attributed to the last content type that a buyer clicked on when checking out a product. As such, across the Analytics pages, transaction related metrics (e.g. Direct GMV, Orders, C_O, GPM, Buyers) for LIVE/ Video will now be updated to reflect the logic change.\n**++LIVE++**++ ++**++Direct GMV & Video Direct GMV++**\n\n* You'll now see **LIVE** **Direct GMV and Video Direct GMV metrics** which previously were not available and are calculated using the **Content Type Based GMV Attribution**\n* LIVE Direct GMV and Video Direct GMV refer to the total amount paid for orders that are placed directly from creator's LIVE or Video, including returns and refunds. This means that GMV is only tabulated based on the last clicked LIVE/VIDEO.\n* Therefore, LIVE Direct GMV and Video Direct GMV are indicators of how effective a livestream or video is in directly **driving conversions and sales**\n\n**No change:** 100% of Affiliate GMV = LIVE + Video + Showcase\n\n* The way commission is calculated for creators will **++not++** change\n* The Affiliate GMV allows you to track the **overall GMV performance,** and takes into account attributed GMV as well. Traditionally, this is what is used to calculate your commission and, as there are no changes to this, this means there will be no changes to how your commission is calculated**.**\n\n# **Data Overview**\nHow to use data overview?\n\n* You can use this to understand the overall transaction performance and sales rate of your bound creators\n* You can also find the percentage of creators with sales to determine the activity of your creators\n* Analyze the live/ video content channels and the number of content releases and and the CTR conversion rate\n\n## Core Data\n\n* **Livestreaming Partners:** The number of partners that have livestreamed during the selected period\n* **Active Rate:** (Active Live Partners/ Partners) * 100%\n* **Partners with Sales:** The number of partners that generated in revenue during the selected period\n* **Sales Rate:** (Partners with Sales/ Partners) * 100%\n\n## Affiliate Performance\n\n* **Affiliate** **GMV:** The cumulative amount paid for orders generated from all partner channels during the selected period, including in-house and Affiliate channels, and including returns and refunds\n* **Est.

Why is it impossible to see video details for some video?\n* Videos, whose status are set to private or deleted, do not support playback and cannot display video pictures;\n* Videos, whose status are set to private and have never been made public, have no transaction or content data;\n2. Why are the recommended videos with high revenue not shown in the transaction analysis in the video detail page?\n* For videos with multiple product links, you need to select one product in the video detail page-transaction analysis, and the video of the TOP3 revenue amount in all videos (including the Creator/Merchants' own short video and other Creator/Merchants' short videos) with the same product will be displayed below the transaction analysis.\n\n# Product Analytics\nUse cases\n**🔥Scenario 1: Monitor every creator's product sales performance**\nAgencies can view the overall sales, commission income, and sales trends of specific accounts for the selected time period by selecting different accounts. By viewing the sales trends of products, you can understand the changes in a specific account's output and ability to sell products. You can also spot accounts which are displaying a significant decrease in their ability to sell products.\n**🔥Scenario 2: View the percentage of deals brought by different creators to the item and the high revenue excellent content**\nAgencies can see the amount and percentage of sales for each creator and the number of live streams/videos that sold the product. Agencies can also see the percentage of sales from different channels of live/video/merchandise cards.\nIt helps agencies find the videos and livestreams that bring the highest sales to the product. Agencies can learn from the best content and imitate the content production methods to create more explosive content.\nPlease note that **GMV** is different than **Direct GMV** because GMV takes into account attributed GMV from affiliates in order to make sure that **the commission paid to Creators via Affiliate Plans does not change.** However, Direct GMV only considers the total amount paid for orders that are placed directly from Videos, including returns and refunds.\n## Select time period\nYou can choose to view data from the the last 28 days, the last 7 days, specific days, weeks or months, and custom time periods.\nNotes:\n\n1.

If the account has not been authorized to view the data for the selected time period, the data cannot be viewed when the time period is selected\n\n<div style=\"text-align: center\"><img src=\"https://p16-arcosite-va.ibyteimg.com/tos-maliva-i-10qhjjqwgv-us/320b6bb833504e0794934757487fe784~tplv-10qhjjqwgv-image.image\" width=\"1470px\" /></div>\n\n## Core data\nYou can select an account and view the performance over a set period of time.
