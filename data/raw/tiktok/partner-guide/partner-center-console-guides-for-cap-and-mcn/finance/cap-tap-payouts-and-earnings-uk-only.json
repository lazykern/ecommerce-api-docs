If a seller has a longer settlement period (e.g., **Delivery + 31 days**), your commission will also be paid 31 days after delivery.\n   * **Refunds or disputes:** Commissions cannot be paid until any product disputes, refund requests, or return requests are resolved.\n\n### What Is the Impact of the Commission Payment Rule Change Effective April 1st, 2025?\nBefore the change:\n\n* You could receive commission as early as **3 days after delivery** and up to **31 days**, depending on various factors.\n* Commissions were **non-refundable**, even if a refund occurred shortly after payment.\n* Payment timelines were unpredictable, varying between **3 to 31 days**.\n\nAfter the change:\n\n* **Fixed timeline:** You will typically receive commission **15 days after delivery** (unless the seller’s settlement period is longer).\n* **Refund adjustments:** Commissions are refundable to sellers if a refund occurs before your payment is processed.\n* **More predictable cash flow:** A standard 15-day payment period ensures better visibility into commission payouts.\n\n### 2.3 Example of the Commission Payment Timeline Change\nLet’s say a product is delivered on **April 5**:\n![Image](https://p16-arcosite-va.ibyteimg.com/tos-maliva-i-10qhjjqwgv-us/0fc8b999e6084d0ba8d7b7e84697d93e~tplv-10qhjjqwgv-image.image)\n### Payment Bills\nThe **Payments** section displays the records of successful payouts, which you can use to reconcile with your bank statements.\n<div style=\"text-align: center\"><img src=\"https://p16-arcosite-va.ibyteimg.com/tos-maliva-i-10qhjjqwgv-us/3281faa31df0462381b72553b10b75d3~tplv-10qhjjqwgv-image.image\" width=\"1280px\" /></div>\n\nIf you want to view the commission details for each payment ID, go to the **Paid** tab on the **Earnings** page to export the commission order details.
