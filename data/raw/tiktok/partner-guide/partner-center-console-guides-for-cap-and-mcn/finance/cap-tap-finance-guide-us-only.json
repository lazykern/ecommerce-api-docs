Possible reasons include:\n   * Orders are not yet completed.\n   * The payout failed due to errors in your bank account details. Please verify your information and click '**Request Payment**' to retry. If it still fails, submit a ticket for assistance.\n   * Your earnings have not yet reached the payout threshold, which is $1.00 for US local partners.\n   You can go to the '**Pending payment**' and '**Payment failed**' tab to check details.\n* **Paid**: this amount reflects the funds that have been successfully transferred to your bank account. You can check details under the '**Paid**' tab.\n\nYou can also export the commission order details to an Excel file for easier reconciliation.\n#### 2.1 When will I receive the commission?\nStarting **April 15, 2025(UTC+0)**, you will receive commissions based on the following rules:\n\n* You will typically receive commission **15 days** after the order delivery date.\n* Some orders may take longer due to:\n   * Commissions are paid only after the seller's orders are settled. Therefore, if the seller's settlement period is longer, such as Delivery + 31 days, commissions will also be paid to you 31 days after delivery.\n   * Commissions can't be paid until the dispute, refund, or return requests are resolved.\n\n#### 2.2 What is the impact of the creator settlement rule change effective April 15, 2025?\nPrior to the change, you typically receive commission **within 15 days** (which could be 1, 5, 8, or 15 days) after the order delivery date, up to 31 days after delivery.\nUnder the new rules, you will typically receive commission **on the 15th day** after the order delivery date, up to 31 days after delivery.\nFor orders created after April 15, 2025, commission will be paid following the new rules. You may experience a temporary earnings dip for about half of the month post-change, but cash flow will normalize over time.\n### Payment Bills\nThe **Payments** section displays the records of successful payouts, which you can use to reconcile with your bank statements.\n<div style=\"text-align: center\"><img src=\"https://p16-arcosite-va.ibyteimg.com/tos-maliva-i-10qhjjqwgv-us/9b55dfcd48934e30b30b9b98665ce343~tplv-10qhjjqwgv-image.image\" width=\"1280px\" /></div>\n\nIf you want to view the commission details for each payment ID, go to the **Paid** tab on the **Earnings** page to export the commission order details.
