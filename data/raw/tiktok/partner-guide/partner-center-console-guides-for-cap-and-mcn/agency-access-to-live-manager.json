Any event created by an agency will be communicated to creators through EC Center notification -> partnership and Creator inbox -> System notification -> Account update\n2. CAPs cannot **initiate or end a go-live on the LIVE Manager**. They can only join livestreams that creators have already started, providing support and management during the live session.\n3. For Cross-border CAPs, this feature is only available to creators who have a commission-sharing or data-sharing relationship with CAP.\n\n\n# FAQs\n### 1. Can a creator cancel LIVE Manager authorization while still being linked?\nYes, if the Creator only wants to cancel Live Manager authorization without affecting the existing linking relationship, the solution would be that CAP and Creator can unlink first, and then CAP can send linking requests **without requesting LIVE Manager access** (by deselecting the LIVE Manager checkbox when sending the link request).\n\n### 2.Does an agency's activity on LIVE Manager notify creators?\nYes, creators will receive notifications when an agency schedules a new LIVE event or enters the LIVE room as staff.\n\n<div style=\"display: flex;\">\n<div style=\"flex-shrink: 0;width: calc((100% - 32px) * 0.3333);\">\n\n\n![Image](https://p16-arcosite-va.ibyteimg.com/tos-maliva-i-10qhjjqwgv-us/1f1287f327844115a891aa4287b489d4~tplv-10qhjjqwgv-image.image)\n\n\n\n</div>\n<div style=\"flex-shrink: 0;width: calc((100% - 32px) * 0.3333);margin-left: 16px;\">\n\n\n![Image](https://p16-arcosite-va.ibyteimg.com/tos-maliva-i-10qhjjqwgv-us/269f029202934d61bcbfaa416b99d05d~tplv-10qhjjqwgv-image.image)\n\n\n\n</div>\n<div style=\"flex-shrink: 0;width: calc((100% - 32px) * 0.3333);margin-left: 16px;\">\n\n\n![Image](https://p16-arcosite-va.ibyteimg.com/tos-maliva-i-10qhjjqwgv-us/8c1c95acb1ae446a9396f7b32ca1c9af~tplv-10qhjjqwgv-image.image)\n\n\n\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n### 3. Are agency activities that happen behind the scenes displayed as creator activities?\nYes, the LIVE room audience cannot distinguish between agency and creator activities, since agencies perform all actions through LIVE Manager under the creator's account. If you notice any suspicious activities by agencies that may harm your interests, please contact your CAP or customer support for investigation.\n\n### 4.Why can't I request a live manager access？\nPlease check if there are any pending Link extension requests. LIVE Manager access cannot be requested while a link extension request is pending, and vice versa \n\n",
