The **Shop Analytics** page is a one-stop hub that gives TSPs the convenience of accessing all those insights and more via 3 performance modules:\n\n1. Overview\n2. Your Sellers\n3. Shop Tab\n\nBy using Shop Analytics, TSPs no longer need to login to various sellers' accounts via Seller Center to analyze various shop performances separately. Read on to learn how to utilise Shop Analytics, or **visit Shop Analytics by navigating to:** [Partner Center > Analytics > Shop](https://partner.tiktokshop.com/compass/shop-analysis)\n*Note: All images shown below are for example purposes only and may not represent the final product.*\n## Overview\nThe Overview tab provides you with comprehensive insights into all your managed shops' performances and is broken down into 4 sections:\n\n* Key Data\n* Shop Ranking\n* Product Ranking\n\n<div style=\"text-align: center\"><img src=\"https://p16-arcosite-va.ibyteimg.com/tos-maliva-i-10qhjjqwgv-us/78a8e758800a417e81d808acacb8d417~tplv-10qhjjqwgv-image.image\" width=\"2186px\" /></div>\n\n### 1.1 Key Data\n<div style=\"text-align: center\"><img src=\"https://p16-arcosite-va.ibyteimg.com/tos-maliva-i-10qhjjqwgv-us/38993a25c0cb446da98b75ccdfc165a4~tplv-10qhjjqwgv-image.image\" width=\"2120px\" /></div>\n\nHere, get a birds-eye view of all your managed shops key performance metrics and toggle on the Trend button to easily analyze a comparison of 2 key metrics on the trendchart above.\n\n* Data shown here is based on the time period selected\n* Review Total GMV with a breakdown of GMV attributed from LIVE, Video, Product, Affiliate, and Ads\n* View indicators of metric performance % versus the same period prior by looking at the green arrows (uptrend) or red arrows (downtrend)\n* Hover over the \"?\" to understand the metric definition\n\n### 1.2 Shop Ranking\nEasily identify your top ranking shops sorted by:\n\n* Highest to lowest GMV\n* Highest to lowest GMV change (how much GMV had changed versus the prior period)\n* Highest to lowest Shop Tab GMV\n\n| **View Shop Ranking by GMV** | **View Shop Ranking by GMV change** | **View Shop Ranking by Shop Tab GMV** |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ![Image](https://p16-arcosite-va.ibyteimg.com/tos-maliva-i-10qhjjqwgv-us/8075e1ac15014405b3008f87eae4af32~tplv-10qhjjqwgv-image.image) <br>  | ![Image](https://p16-arcosite-va.ibyteimg.com/tos-maliva-i-10qhjjqwgv-us/fe16bdb31973418e80cf260f94d3b8cf~tplv-10qhjjqwgv-image.image) <br>  | ![Image](https://p16-arcosite-va.ibyteimg.com/tos-maliva-i-10qhjjqwgv-us/b4a2794be6b44a4ebdc683bb0e58755c~tplv-10qhjjqwgv-image.image) <br>  |\n| * Click View All to open the \"My Sellers\" page for the full list of shops <br> * Click Export to download the list for an offline analysis |  |  |\n*Tip: Review the GMV distribution % to identify shops or products that have a high GMV attribution within your total managed seller pool.
