It serves as an introduction to the partner's capabilities and acts as an online service invitation extended to TikTok Shop sellers. These services can be made public, available for all sellers to see and authorize (Public Service), or they can be shared privately with specific sellers the partner has already connected with (Custom Service).\nThere are two types of services.\n\n* **Public:**\n   * Intended for services that partners want to showcase on the **App & Service Store**, allowing them to be browsed and authorized by any seller.\n   * To publish a \"public\" service, partners must provide additional service information and pass a review process because it will be displayed on the App & Service Store.\n* **Custom:**\n   * Designed for services that partners specifically want to offer to a particular client with whom they have an established connection.\n   * Publishing a \"custom\" service does not require a review process before it can be authorized by sellers.\n\nIn short, TikTok Shop Services provide partners with a flexible way to present their service offerings and invite sellers to utilize their services, either publicly or through private channels. The choice between \"public\" and \"custom\" services depends on the partner's target audience and authorization preferences.\n# Publishing a public service\n![Image](https://p16-arcosite-va.ibyteimg.com/tos-maliva-i-10qhjjqwgv-us/38f450916ded4974a55db6dfe62c3e94~tplv-10qhjjqwgv-image.image)\n# Publish a custom service\n![Image](https://p16-arcosite-va.ibyteimg.com/tos-maliva-i-10qhjjqwgv-us/090f3684bff14f3bac458a6bae0f7ca8~tplv-10qhjjqwgv-image.image)\n# Steps to create a service\nClick \"Create app&service\" to create your first service\n![Image](https://p16-arcosite-va.ibyteimg.com/tos-maliva-i-10qhjjqwgv-us/a9d0d530c98846ac91a9737d1c60a81f~tplv-10qhjjqwgv-image.image)\nChoose the service type according to your needs and provide related content ( referring to [Listing your service on the App & Service Store](650411a75a12ff0294023d30))\nNOTE: Please ensure you select the correct TSP category for publishing your service.
