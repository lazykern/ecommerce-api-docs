  "title": " [US] TikTok Shop Partner Tiering Mechanism",
  "content": "The TikTok Shop Partners('TSP') tiering system is designed to cultivate a robust ecosystem, set service benchmarks, and offer customized resources for TSP at various development stages—thereby guiding their growth path.\n*This Tiering Mechanism only applies to TikTok Shop Partners certified and operating in the US market.* \n\n# **Rules for TSP Tiering** \n## **2.1 TSP Tiers**\n**For regular type TSPs**\nTSPs will be divided into 6 tiers from V0 to V5, corresponding to the V0 TSP->V1 Certified TSP->V2 Bronze TSP->V3 Silver TSP->V4 Gold TSP->V5 Platinum TSP levels. The higher the agency's rating, the stronger its comprehensive promotion capabilities.\n**For TSPs that focus on providing seller acquisition services**\nThere will be an isolated tiering system to measure their tiers and provide them with corresponding operational tips, rights and benefits.\n## **2.2 TSP Tier Calculation Rules & Key Evaluation Metrics** \n### **2.2.1 Main Evaluation Metrics**\nAfter successfully registered as a TSP, partners will be evaluated and scored based on their selected service type(s) (single or multiple, including Creator Service, Seller Service - General, and Seller Service - Creator Matchmaking).\nCurrently, our service provider rating primarily focuses on ① performance. Evaluations of ② capabilities and ③ compliance status will be gradually introduced at a later stage.\n| **Service Type** | **①Performance Metrics** |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Seller Service** | ![Image](https://p16-arcosite-va.ibyteimg.com/tos-maliva-i-10qhjjqwgv-us/8797d2204e1748009a78092dc7814041~tplv-10qhjjqwgv-image.image) |\n| **Creator Service** | ![Image](https://p16-arcosite-va.ibyteimg.com/tos-maliva-i-10qhjjqwgv-us/0fd578d839174a0698560deb6740a4d1~tplv-10qhjjqwgv-image.image) |\n| **Creator Matchmaking** | ![Image](https://p16-arcosite-va.ibyteimg.com/tos-maliva-i-10qhjjqwgv-us/25bc964da9694f7c85c3bb5b344209b8~tplv-10qhjjqwgv-image.image) |\n### **2.2.2 Calculation Rules**\n**Scoring Rules:**\n\n1. Single Service: The overall rating is calculated as the final score × 90% service weight.\n2. Multiple Services: The overall rating is calculated as the average score of each service × 110% - 130% service weight.\n\n**Tier Determination**: \n\n1. The composite rating falls into the corresponding score range to determine the final tier. Tier promotion follows a step-by-step mechanism to ensure steady growth. For example, a TSP rated V1 in the prior evaluation cannot skip to V3 in the new rating. Instead, upgrading to V2 is a mandatory prerequisite before this TSP advancing to V3.\n2. For rating as a V4 partner, partners must have at least one single service score ≥80 points and an overall score ≥80 points.\n3. For rating as a V5 partner, partners must have at least one single service score >100 points and an overall score >100 points.\n\n**Score Range of TSP Tier**\n![Image](https://p16-arcosite-va.ibyteimg.com/tos-maliva-i-10qhjjqwgv-us/e6e2b1726e684cb1a42cbd98db3c4a5b~tplv-10qhjjqwgv-image.image)\n\n**Service Type x Service Weight**\n\n![Image](https://p16-arcosite-va.ibyteimg.com/tos-maliva-i-10qhjjqwgv-us/e0a9a44c15dd48dabac9b2d569cc223c~tplv-10qhjjqwgv-image.image)\n\n## **2.3 TSP Tier Update Schedule** \n\n1. The TSP tier will be updated on the 3rd~5th day of each following month, and it will be calculated according to the performance data of the partner in the previous month.\n2. There may be a delay in updating the tiering results, and the actual update will be based on the notification within the product. \n3. The tiering result is automatically calculated by the system based on various indicators. Since it is not a point-deduction system, appeals are not supported yet.\n4. A violation point system will be implemented in the near future.\n\n\n# **Rights and Benefits of Different TSP Tiers**\nThe platform grants TSPs different rights and benefits based on their tier levels and makes timely adjustments according to the rollout schedule of these benefits.\nThe rights and benefits available to TSPs at different tiers include, but are not limited to: access to honor awards, account/store protect and appeal, livestream support, exclusive event privileges, operation support, and more.\nThe different rights and benefits are matched according to the tier level of the TSP agency, and the specific approval standards follow the overall requirements. (To be continued)\n## Detailed Rights and Benefits \nHere are some of the rights and benefits associated with partners in different tiers. More benefits will be gradually launched. Please consult your partner AMs for more information.\nNote： The specific requirements for the use of rights and interests shall be subject to the actual situation.\n![Image](https://p16-arcosite-va.ibyteimg.com/tos-maliva-i-10qhjjqwgv-us/9e58ff728f3d4fb38f24cf4671ef0b51~tplv-10qhjjqwgv-image.image)\n\n\n# How to check Partner Tiering on TikTok Shop Partner Center?\nAll the tiering labels can be visible on TikTok Shop Partner Center( [https://partner.us.tiktokshop.com/](https://partner.us.tiktokshop.com/)）\nAfter logging in, partners will receive a notification to review the new tiering rules after the partner tier is officially launched.
