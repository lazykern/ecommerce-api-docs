Taking this into account, we've introduced an account management feature, enabling you to set up the main account and assign roles to team members for enhanced efficiency.\n\n* **Main Account:** The main account serves as the administrator, having control over all member accounts. The main account administrator can create, preview, and edit member accounts for any users.\n* **Member** **Account:** A member account is created by the main account. The main account can generate multiple member accounts and assign different roles to staff, each with unique permissions for daily operations, such as managing data or overseeing creators/sellers.\n\n<div style=\"text-align: center\"><img src=\"https://p16-arcosite-va.ibyteimg.com/tos-maliva-i-10qhjjqwgv-us/5571734a6d7d40858732e86a4cd75036~tplv-10qhjjqwgv-image.image\" width=\"1280px\" /></div>\n\n# Benefits of Adding Main and Member Accounts\n\n* **Improved Security:** Assigning member accounts and roles enhances security by granting limited access on a need-to-know basis, reducing the risk of unauthorised use and data breaches.\n* **Streamlined Workflow:** By assigning specific roles, team members can focus on their specific responsibilities and partner roles, promoting efficiency and preventing confusion over tasks.\n* **Enhanced Flexibility:** By assigning roles, team members can work independently using individual member accounts, helping you manage your business more efficiently.\n\n<div style=\"text-align: center\"><img src=\"https://p16-arcosite-va.ibyteimg.com/tos-maliva-i-10qhjjqwgv-us/521b868cce454657ac2fe26859413546~tplv-10qhjjqwgv-image.image\" width=\"1280px\" /></div>\n\n# How to Add Member Accounts and Assigning Roles\nTo create and assign member accounts to different roles, begin by defining a role and its permissions. Then, assign this role to your member accounts. Follow these step-by-step instructions for guidance.\n## Customizing Role Permissions\n\n1. Navigate to [My Account > Team Members](https://partner.tiktokshop.com/approval/team-management)**.** Under **Added Roles** tab, click **'Add New Role.'**\n\n<div style=\"text-align: center\"><img src=\"https://p16-arcosite-va.ibyteimg.com/tos-maliva-i-10qhjjqwgv-us/a32b9f3020f94a82bc3ae0cc6364a440~tplv-10qhjjqwgv-image.image\" width=\"2846px\" /></div>\n\n\n2.

Ensure you log out of any existing accounts in the Partner Center before logging in with your new member account.
