Once the platform has reviewed and approved certification details, these certification details cannot be changed. However, there may be instances where a partner needs to update their certification details, such as their name, logo, etc.\n![Image](https://p16-arcosite-va.ibyteimg.com/tos-maliva-i-10qhjjqwgv-us/64d2ad25a8e642e3a6299214195d7c94~tplv-10qhjjqwgv-image.image)\n![Image](https://p16-arcosite-va.ibyteimg.com/tos-maliva-i-10qhjjqwgv-us/2349f12e9f8849e79f3124d231cd8928~tplv-10qhjjqwgv-image.image)\nTo streamline this process and improve partners' experience, we are now automating this process and offering partners the capability to edit certification details directly on TTSPC.\n## ⭐️ **Feature introduction**\n### Step 1 Precondition and entrance of editing certification\nYou can go to [My Account➤Profile➤ My category](https://partner.tiktokshop.com/approval/profile) to view the certification details for each category.
