  "title": "Partner Campaign (US Only)",
  "content": "# Overview\nThis guide covers how agencies can use Partner Campaigns to create campaigns between Sellers and Creators. With this tool, Sellers can register and submit products to an agency's campaign, and determine the commission they would like to offer to the agency. Then the agency chooses the commission they would like to set for the managed or unmanaged Creators they've selected for the campaign. Agencies share product links with the Creators so they can add the products to their showcases and promote them. The commission splitting is then completed online via the tool.\nPartner Campaigns offers several benefits:\n\n* For Agencies: A new revenue stream that allows agencies to collect commission from Sellers by setting up affiliate campaigns on their behalf.\n* For Sellers: A way to outsource the creation of campaigns and selection of Creators to agencies. Sellers can apply to campaigns in the Partner Campaigns tab, described in more detail in the Seller experience section of this article.\n* For Creators: More opportunities to earn affiliate commissions from product lists curated by the agencies. Participating Creators do not have to be managed by the agency.\n\n**Recent Updates as of February 2024:**\n\n* Ability to edit Partner Campaign details\n* Easier ways to create Product Lists and set up commission rates with creators\n* Ability to add more products to an existing Product List\n* Ability to duplicate Product Lists\n* Ability to delete Product Lists\n* Ability to search for specific Product Lists\n* Ability to bookmark products and filter for bookmarked products\n* More performance data, including sample shipping status and viewing content made with samples\n\n# Onboarding Requirements\nStep 1: If you already have a TikTok Shop Partner Center account, skip to step 2.

In the Basic information section, describe in detail what this campaign is about and make it compelling for Sellers to want to participate. Then, set the registration period, which is the dates during which sellers can register products to the campaign, followed by the campaign period, which is teh dates during which creators can promote the products. The start date for the registration period and the campaign period must always be the same. Note that under the Seller information section, you can choose to make the campaign open to all Sellers or only select Sellers by inputting their Shop Codes (you can add up to 100 Shop Codes). Sellers can find Shop Codes in the Seller Center by going to My Account-> Seller Profile-> Seller Information. After you have filled in all the relevant details, click **Submit**.\n![Image](https://p16-arcosite-va.ibyteimg.com/tos-maliva-i-10qhjjqwgv-us/465e6038ae7947d5ae6f4202a035ca62~tplv-10qhjjqwgv-image.image)\n![Image](https://p16-arcosite-va.ibyteimg.com/tos-maliva-i-10qhjjqwgv-us/c99ab26a5f07464ea60a40ed35b927cb~tplv-10qhjjqwgv-image.image)\nStep 3: After clicking **Submit**, you will be taken to the main **Campaigns** page. All of your created campaigns will be listed here. To publish the campaign to Sellers, you ++must++ turn on the **Publish Toggle**. On this page, you can also create more campaigns by clicking **Create Campaign**.\n**Note:** If you are trying to work with \"Local\" or \"All\" sellers, please make sure to write your campaign details in English.\n# Approving/Rejecting Seller Products\nStep 1: After Sellers have registered products for your campaign, you can click into the **Campaign details** page to see all the registered products, the Shop information, the price of the product, the number of items sold, and the commission rates that Sellers are offering for this campaign. Note that this is the total commission rate that will be paid to you and the Creators in the campaign. Below that, you can also see how this commission rate compares to the commission rate the seller is offering for this product via a collaboration.\n![Image](https://p16-arcosite-va.ibyteimg.com/tos-maliva-i-10qhjjqwgv-us/86da21f478a94b18830a742d82026a49~tplv-10qhjjqwgv-image.image)\nStep 2: On the **Pending** tab, you must choose to **Approve** or **Reject** a Seller's product registration. Note that after you approve the registration, you will not be able to modify the commission rates set by the Seller. If you reject the registration, you will be asked if you would like to allow the Seller to re-register, and you will be able to give the Seller a reason for the initial rejection.\n![Image](https://p16-arcosite-va.ibyteimg.com/tos-maliva-i-10qhjjqwgv-us/205adef132ce4ce39daf03aff705330d~tplv-10qhjjqwgv-image.image)\n![Image](https://p16-arcosite-va.ibyteimg.com/tos-maliva-i-10qhjjqwgv-us/81363fe04fdc4281a605ed93289ae067~tplv-10qhjjqwgv-image.image)\n![Image](https://p16-arcosite-va.ibyteimg.com/tos-maliva-i-10qhjjqwgv-us/eac96cfebdb94015aedcebca5b191ace~tplv-10qhjjqwgv-image.image)\nStep 3: You can navigate to the **Approved** tab to see a list of approved products. Here, select products individually or in bulk, and then click on **Export links** to generate links to share with the Creators, which will allow them to view the products in the campaign and add them to their showcase. In order to export the links, you must first set a **commission rate** that you want to offer the Creators. It must be less than or equal to the campaign's total commission rate. For example, if the Seller is offering a campaign total commission rate of 30%, then the commission rate you offer to the participating Creators must be less than or equal to 30%. If you set the commission rate here as 15%, then that means Creators will receive 15% and you will receive the other 15% of the commission. On this page, you can also mark products using the **Bookmark button**, and then you can filter for **Marked products, **as well as filter by product name and category.\n![Image](https://p16-arcosite-va.ibyteimg.com/tos-maliva-i-10qhjjqwgv-us/a4a25e9217ca4d8fab23521e9c5ebdc4~tplv-10qhjjqwgv-image.image)\n<div style=\"text-align: center\"><img src=\"https://p16-arcosite-va.ibyteimg.com/tos-maliva-i-10qhjjqwgv-us/49a26b643d9545bdb24a1125b9a11ece~tplv-10qhjjqwgv-image.image\" width=\"488px\" /></div>\n\nStep 4: Rather than sending individual product links, you can also create a list of products to send to Creators by clicking on **Product lists** and then pressing **Create a product list**. Note that if you already have several product lists, you can search by product name and ID to find specific lists with those products.\n![Image](https://p16-arcosite-va.ibyteimg.com/tos-maliva-i-10qhjjqwgv-us/48a672d82be440f3923fcd18bd3e6e89~tplv-10qhjjqwgv-image.image)\nStep 5: First, give your product list a name, then press **Add products**. Next, select the products you want to include in the list (up to 100). Here, you can search for products by name and category, as well as by marked products that you have bookmarked. Once ready, press **Add**. Then, set the commission for each product separately, or in bulk by selecting multiple products and then clicking **Setup commission in bulk**. Remember that you have to set the commission that the creator should receive, as well as the commission that you as the agency would like to receive. For example, if the total commission rate is 10%, then the Creator commission rate and the Affiliate partner commission rate must add up to 10%. Once you are finished setting the commission rates, press **Review list.**\n![Image](https://p16-arcosite-va.ibyteimg.com/tos-maliva-i-10qhjjqwgv-us/f6c196d2869a497ca26456bbf15b1d00~tplv-10qhjjqwgv-image.image)\n![Image](https://p16-arcosite-va.ibyteimg.com/tos-maliva-i-10qhjjqwgv-us/cada6f276417436e9509d1cc25f1dbcf~tplv-10qhjjqwgv-image.image)\n![Image](https://p16-arcosite-va.ibyteimg.com/tos-maliva-i-10qhjjqwgv-us/7682cdf1fa7944eaa81a72a1987b8f24~tplv-10qhjjqwgv-image.image)\n![Image](https://p16-arcosite-va.ibyteimg.com/tos-maliva-i-10qhjjqwgv-us/bbd9f3e9e8984df8a3bc75f442a3bbe4~tplv-10qhjjqwgv-image.image)\nStep 6: After reviewing your list, press **Create**.

The Creator can **Add all to showcase** or add them individually. When a Creator clicks into a product details page, they can see the commission rate and **Add to showcase**. The commission rate that is shown to the Creator is the commission rate they are paid by the agency, not the Seller.\n| The list of products in the campaign | Commission rate | Add to showcase | Added to showcase |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![Image](https://p16-arcosite-va.ibyteimg.com/tos-maliva-i-10qhjjqwgv-us/88beaf730d294ff78162f84449a61746~tplv-10qhjjqwgv-image.image) | ![Image](https://p16-arcosite-va.ibyteimg.com/tos-maliva-i-10qhjjqwgv-us/ad4de8a801714933a44d6162f72c333a~tplv-10qhjjqwgv-image.image) | ![Image](https://p16-arcosite-va.ibyteimg.com/tos-maliva-i-10qhjjqwgv-us/44c56593014a40f59864e3287255054f~tplv-10qhjjqwgv-image.image) | ![Image](https://p16-arcosite-va.ibyteimg.com/tos-maliva-i-10qhjjqwgv-us/ef4f0c6ff87241e08cba2ee47cca1a1b~tplv-10qhjjqwgv-image.image) |\nStep 4: In cases when the commission rate in this campaign is lower than the commission rate the Creator is already receiving for a product or list, the Creator will receive alerts that their commission will decrease if they add the products from this campaign.\n![Image](https://p16-arcosite-va.ibyteimg.com/tos-maliva-i-10qhjjqwgv-us/aa12b2bfde5f4b4a8460d1c4a108981d~tplv-10qhjjqwgv-image.image)\nStep 5: If after entering a link, a Creator receives a **No available products yet **or **The product list wasn't found** message, it means that the campaign does not have any products in it yet or that the agency has deleted the product or list.\n| No available products yet | The product list wasn't found |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![Image](https://p16-arcosite-va.ibyteimg.com/tos-maliva-i-10qhjjqwgv-us/df0cc468430b4e5ea0ae6fb3bd1592e4~tplv-10qhjjqwgv-image.image) | ![Image](https://p16-arcosite-va.ibyteimg.com/tos-maliva-i-10qhjjqwgv-us/39a48f757a73498589374b53515be811~tplv-10qhjjqwgv-image.image) |\nStep 6: In the **Affiliate orders** page, Creators will be shown when a sale and commission is from an agency-led campaign.\n![Image](https://p16-arcosite-va.ibyteimg.com/tos-maliva-i-10qhjjqwgv-us/ded6dd29fbe1499aa1fd2ec055af386a~tplv-10qhjjqwgv-image.image)\n# FAQ\n\n1. **What happens if the agency that created the Partner Campaign is also linked to one of the Creators participating in the campaign?**\n\nThe agency can only collect commission from the Seller. The agency cannot collect commission from the Creator, as this would be considered \"double dipping.\"\n\n2. **What happens if the agency that created the Partner Campaign invites a Creator to the campaign who is managed by another agency?**\n\nThe agency that created the campaign will still receive a commission from the Seller and can decide how much of that commission to give to the Creator. The remaining commission that goes to the Creator is then split between the Creator and the agency that manages the Creator, based on the existing agreement between both parties.\n\n3. **Can sellers see creator-specific performance data?**\n\nNo, sellers cannot see creator-specific performance data. Sellers are only able to view product-specific performance data. Partner Campaigns are therefore recommended for sellers who are eager to outsource their work to agencies, but do not require detailed insights into creator-specific sales performance.\n\n4. **How can I edit existing Partner Campaigns?**\n\nIn the Campaign details page, press the **Edit** button. Here, you can edit key details of the campaign, you can add more shop codes, and you can view the uploaded shop codes. Press **Update** once you are done making changes. Once updated, your changes will take effect within 30 minutes and you cannot make edits during this period. Once it takes effect, you can continue to edit until the end of the campaign period.\n![Image](https://p16-arcosite-va.ibyteimg.com/tos-maliva-i-10qhjjqwgv-us/a9abcde8ab66458a8e070b8b054ef6ac~tplv-10qhjjqwgv-image.image)\n![Image](https://p16-arcosite-va.ibyteimg.com/tos-maliva-i-10qhjjqwgv-us/11c655bafe1f49108322651115d9ac16~tplv-10qhjjqwgv-image.image)\n# Partner Campaign - Exclusive TikTok Shop\nExclusive TikTok Shop is a campaign type within Partner Campaign in Affiliate Center which features products handpicked by TikTok for their outstanding performance.
