As such, it is important for TAP agencies to monitor their creators' affiliate link performances to optimise this new channel of commission generation. With that, we have introduced a new module called **Links** that allows TAP agencies to quickly grasp creators' overall affiliate links performances.\nTo get a quick refresher of how affiliate links work for Creators, feel free to read the flowchart below:\n<div style=\"text-align: center\"><img src=\"https://p16-arcosite-va.ibyteimg.com/tos-maliva-i-10qhjjqwgv-us/3a750aa0242546cc9f470ddad4cf0d77~tplv-10qhjjqwgv-image.image\" width=\"2880px\" /></div>\n\n# Benefits of Monitoring Affiliate Link Performance\n\n1. **Identify Creators' Link channels with high traffic** to guide Creators in optimising the relevant traffic channels to boost commission.\n2. **Easily view overall Affiliate Links attribution towards key metrics like GMV, Orders, Est. Commission and more** to understand the effectiveness of affiliate links for Creators.\n3. **Engage with Creators with a custom performance report** where you can analyse how Affiliate Links impact different dimensions and form a different affiliate link strategy for each Creator.\n\n*Please be aware that the data presented in the below screenshots is not from an actual account and is intended for visual demonstration purposes.*\n![Image](https://p16-arcosite-va.ibyteimg.com/tos-maliva-i-10qhjjqwgv-us/dd523f9936184f8ba99e277d99d4cc3b~tplv-10qhjjqwgv-image.image)\n# Navigating to the Links module\nNavigate to: [Partner Centre > Analytics > Data Overview](https://partner.tiktokshop.com/compass/data-overview)\nThe **Links** module can be found within the GMV Performance module on the **Data Overview page**, as shown below:\n<div style=\"text-align: center\"><img src=\"https://p16-arcosite-va.ibyteimg.com/tos-maliva-i-10qhjjqwgv-us/2d06a32e94d44faeac3b1e42fe354a7c~tplv-10qhjjqwgv-image.image\" width=\"1108px\" /></div>\n\n![Image](https://p16-arcosite-va.ibyteimg.com/tos-maliva-i-10qhjjqwgv-us/068eb92b76b646baba2a79e3734c9445~tplv-10qhjjqwgv-image.image)\n# ![Image](https://p16-arcosite-va.ibyteimg.com/tos-maliva-i-10qhjjqwgv-us/33e54415b5354021b50dc73d22a85899~tplv-10qhjjqwgv-image.image)\n# How to Analyse Affiliate Link Performance?\n![Image](https://p16-arcosite-va.ibyteimg.com/tos-maliva-i-10qhjjqwgv-us/24833b9e04f54383a456d75387e25fd0~tplv-10qhjjqwgv-image.image)\n\n1.
