The main workflow is as follows:\n**Step1 Affiliate Partner creates a campaign and guides sellers to view campaign and register products**\nAffiliate Partner can create campaigns for targeted sellers/public sellers, including campaign registration time, promotion time and commission requirements. Affiliate Partner guides sellers to view campaigns and register products in the seller center\n**Step 2 After the cooperation is reached, during the product promotion time, Affiliate partner can copy the product link and promote it with creators.**\nAfter the Affiliate Partner has reviewed and approved the registered products of the sellers, Affiliate Partner can distribute product links and distribute them to the creators offline.\n**Step 3 After the creator accepts and adds the product to the showcase to sell , affiliate partner can earn commission from the sold order.**\nAfter the creator adds the product link and sells goods, the affiliate partner can earn the commission set by the merchant\n##### <span style=\"color: rgb(216, 57, 49)\">[IMPT] Commission Calculation Logic</span>\n<span style=\"color: rgb(216, 57, 49)\">There are three partnership models and each has its own commission calculation logic. Below are illustrations of how they operate.</span>\n\n1. <span style=\"color: rgb(216, 57, 49)\"><strong>Affiliate Partners</strong></span>\n\n> Partnership with Non-binding creators.\n\n<span style=\"color: rgb(216, 57, 49)\">Commission Calculation: All commission rates of products will be calculated based on the commission split setup during link creation by the agency before sharing it with creators</span>\n\n2. **Agencies functioning as both Creator Management Agency (MCN/CAP) and Affiliate Partners (TAP)**\n\n> In this scenario, creators are bound with a MCN/CAP Agency, and add Campaign Product links from the same agency who also works as a TAP partner to their showcases.\n\nCommission calculation: The agency takes both the TAP commission from Campaign Commission, as well as the CAP/MCN commission based on the Commission Sharing Agreement signed with the binding Creators.\n> What this means: If a creator has a commission sharing relationship with MCN/CAP Agency, the commission for the creator will be shared with MCN/CAP Agency based on the commission sharing rate with MCN/CAP Agency.\n> *For example: If a* *Seller* *sets a total commission of 20% for a product, dividing it as 10% for the affiliate partner (as a TAP Agency) and 10% for the Creator, and the Creator has a 50% commission-sharing arrangement signed with the same affiliate partner (as a MCN/CAP Agency), the Creator will effectively receive 5% commission.*\n\n#### Step 1 Create Campaign\nAfter completing the settle-in process and active account as an Affiliate Partner, you can log in to the TTSPC, and create campaign through **[Campaign] ➤ [My Campaign] ➤ [Create Campaign]**.\n<div style=\"text-align: center\"><img src=\"https://p16-arcosite-va.ibyteimg.com/tos-maliva-i-10qhjjqwgv-us/7306e2881ce94c60badf607a084e55b2~tplv-10qhjjqwgv-image.image\" width=\"3741px\" /></div>\n\nPlease refer to [Campaign Information instructions](https://bytedance.feishu.cn/docx/QqsGdWOWYoS82Yx34ewc3MPcnLg#doxcnPFDiFcgydCUQlpuqQd5RFP) and fill in the campaign information，After checking, click [Submit] to go to the campaign list.\n<div style=\"text-align: center\"><img src=\"https://p16-arcosite-va.ibyteimg.com/tos-maliva-i-10qhjjqwgv-us/5e5264a98b9441009114b591447bee9c~tplv-10qhjjqwgv-image.image\" width=\"1280px\" /></div>\n\n##### <span style=\"background-color: rgba(255, 246, 122, 0.8)\">Campaign Information instructions [Important]</span>\n| File | Explanation | requirements |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Campaign title | Seller will catch the Campaign title quickly.
