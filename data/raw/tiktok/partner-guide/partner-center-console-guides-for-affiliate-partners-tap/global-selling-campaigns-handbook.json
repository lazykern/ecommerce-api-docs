If you don't have in-house creators, feel free to skip this step. Participating in Global Selling Campaigns doesn't necessarily require this step.\n#### Adding a Self-Incubated Collaboration Relationship\nStep 1: partners should open \"**Creator Management**\" > **\"Manage Partnership**\" from the sidebar and click on \"**Manage exclusive partnership**.\"\n<div style=\"text-align: center\"><img src=\"https://p16-arcosite-va.ibyteimg.com/tos-maliva-i-10qhjjqwgv-us/a354ad33ef06436db3b691cf27017fa6~tplv-10qhjjqwgv-image.image\" width=\"2346px\" /></div>\n\n**Step 2**: In the dropdown menu, partners can search for the already linked creator accounts (supporting multiple selections, up to 10 at a time) and click \"**Request**\" to submit the request.
