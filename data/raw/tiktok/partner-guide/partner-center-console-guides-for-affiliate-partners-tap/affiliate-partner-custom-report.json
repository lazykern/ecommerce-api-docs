If an agency provides TSP or MCN/CAP services as well as the TAP services, at present they will only be able to see the Custom Report data in the region their TAP service is linked to.\n   1. For example: If an agency is registered as an MCN/CAP in both MY and ID but is registered as an Affiliate Partner in MY only, then they will only be able to open the Custom Report page in MY region.\n2. The region in Custom Report will not automatically be the same as the region selected on other tabs of the Analytics section.\n   1. For example: An agency is registered as an ++MCN/CAP and Affiliate Partner++ in both MY and ID. While viewing data in the Video Analytics tab, they switch their region from ID to MY. However, when they open the Custom Report tab, the region will revert back to ID instead of remaining consistent with the region they were viewing in the Video Analytics tab.\n\n## **Using Dimensions**\nWithin the Dimensions section, you can select a number of different dimensions. Dimensions correspond to the headings displayed in your search results.\n\n1. **Time Dimension** — Here, you can select from **one of the below.**\n   1. By Day\n   2. By Week (starting on Sunday)\n   3. By Month\n   4. By Entire Period (extends 6 months into the past and is selected by default when the time dimension is checked)\n\n![Image](https://p16-arcosite-va.ibyteimg.com/tos-maliva-i-10qhjjqwgv-us/9d2b7ba821de4595a5289de896131052~tplv-10qhjjqwgv-image.image)\n\n1. **Other Dimensions** — you can **multi-select** any of the below. The only exception is that LIVE and Video cannot be selected together.\n\nNote: When you select each dimension, **all the types associated with that dimension** are automatically selected and will be displayed in your results.\n| **Dimension** | **Types** |\n| --- | --- |\n| Campaign | Campaign ID, Campaign name, Campaign status, Campaign validation, Campaign time info |\n| Creator | Creator name, Creator nickname |\n| LIVE | Room ID, Livestream name, Time info |\n| Video | Video ID, Video name, Post time |\n| Product | Product ID, Product name |\n| Shop | Shop ID, Shop name |\n| Product category | Product category (level 1-2) |\n![Image](https://p16-arcosite-va.ibyteimg.com/tos-maliva-i-10qhjjqwgv-us/4697133db8bb43a8bd77f2420db89972~tplv-10qhjjqwgv-image.image)\n## **Using Filters**\nFilters can help you better refine search results. You can select from the time filter as well as the categories, as detailed below.\n\n1. **Time** — both fixed and dynamic time periods are supported, with the oldest date option 6 months in the past.\n   1. **Fixed Date Range:** Select your desired date range in the calendar box.\n   2. **Dynamic Date Range:** Select from one of the following:\n      1. Last 7 days\n      2.

With batch input, you can separate each item by a comma and paste a maximum of 500 items per filter.\n   1. You can select whether you want to **Include or Exclude** the items you have pasted for each filter.\n   2. This section is useful as it allows you to refine your results so that the data displayed will only be for the items you have added into the filters.\n\n![Image](https://p16-arcosite-va.ibyteimg.com/tos-maliva-i-10qhjjqwgv-us/bfa881465759473d86bb260158a5d173~tplv-10qhjjqwgv-image.image)\n![Image](https://p16-arcosite-va.ibyteimg.com/tos-maliva-i-10qhjjqwgv-us/17eef058a0ad465fb1a77aa453e0098d~tplv-10qhjjqwgv-image.image)\n## **Exporting data**\n\n1. Once you have selected your dimensions and filters, press **Search** to get the corresponding results. You will see the total number of search results provided.\n\nNote: If the number of search results is greater than 500, only the top 500 results will be displayed which you can view by navigating through the different pages. To view the additional results, you'll need to press **Export**, which will then export **all results** to Excel.\n![Image](https://p16-arcosite-va.ibyteimg.com/tos-maliva-i-10qhjjqwgv-us/b859a2bf442648b0968c458dd7602485~tplv-10qhjjqwgv-image.image)\nTo export this data to Excel, click on the **Export** icon on the right. This will automatically download **all items** into an Excel file that will be saved to your laptop.\n![Image](https://p16-arcosite-va.ibyteimg.com/tos-maliva-i-10qhjjqwgv-us/c56d6434c3c0471fbd9c3aee064731f3~tplv-10qhjjqwgv-image.image)\nYou'll also see the **Export report** icon, which lists previous reports you have exported and which you can still download within 7 days (max 500,000 records can be displayed).\n![Image](https://p16-arcosite-va.ibyteimg.com/tos-maliva-i-10qhjjqwgv-us/934cbec58016402a80e2bbff31d445f4~tplv-10qhjjqwgv-image.image)\n# **FAQs**\n\n1. **Can I choose which corresponding type for a selected dimension I want in my search results?**\n\nNo, you cannot select an individual type associated with the dimension. All types linked to the dimension will automatically be selected and displayed in your results.\nFor instance, if you select the LIVE dimension, your search results will automatically display all associated types: Room ID, Livestream name and Time info.\n\n1. **Is Custom Report available for MCN/CAP or TSP service categories as well?**\n\nCurrently, only Affiliate Partners can access Custom Report, but we will be launching this function for MCN/CAP in the next few months.\n\n",
