  "content": "# Path: /product/202407/products/category_upgrade_task\n# Method: [POST]\n# Function Description\nCreate a task to upgrade live products (status: `ACTIVATE`) from a 3-level to a 7-level category tree.\nThe task runs for up to 2 hours, depending on the number of products. If the upgrade is incomplete after 2 hours, call the API again. To figure out which products' categories have not been upgraded, call the [Search Product API](https://partner.tiktokshop.com/docv2/page/65854ffb8f559302d8a6acda) and set \"category_version\" to \"v1\".\n**Note**: You must wait at least 24 hours after a product goes live to successfully upgrade its category. If you call this API on the same day a new product goes live, the system will be unable to detect it.\n\n---\n\n\n# Common Parameters\nFor common parameters, refer to [How to call TikTok Shop APIs - Common Parameters](https://partner.tiktokshop.com/docv2/page/64f199679495ef0281851ee5#Back%20To%20Top)\n| Properties <!-- width:110px --> | Location <!-- width:75px --> | Type <!-- width:75px --> | Require <!-- width:60px --> | Sample <!-- width:254px --> | Properties description <!-- width:254px --> |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| shop_cipher | query | string | Y | GCP_XF90igAAAABh00qsWgtvOiGFNqyubMt3 | Use this property to pass shop information in requesting the API.
