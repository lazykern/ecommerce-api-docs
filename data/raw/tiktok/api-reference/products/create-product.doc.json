Otherwise, they can continue to use the [Create Global Product API](6509de61bace3e02b7489cba) to create global products.\n* Before calling this API, we recommend that you prepare the necessary information by following the [usage flow for your region](650b23eef1fd3102b93d2326).\n* There may be a limit to the number of products you can list per day. We recommend prioritizing the creation of key products first to ensure they get published. Refer to TikTok Shop Academy for details on the limit.\n* The language used in the product content must align with the target market's language (e.g. don't use Chinese), otherwise the listing will fail or be rejected.\n\n\n---\n\n\n# Common Parameters\nFor common parameters, refer to [How to call TikTok Shop APIs - Common Parameters](https://partner.tiktokshop.com/docv2/page/64f199679495ef0281851ee5#Back%20To%20Top)\n| Properties <!-- width:110px --> | Location <!-- width:75px --> | Type <!-- width:75px --> | Require <!-- width:60px --> | Sample <!-- width:254px --> | Properties description <!-- width:254px --> |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| shop_cipher | query | string | Y | GCP_XF90igAAAABh00qsWgtvOiGFNqyubMt3 | Use this property to pass shop information in requesting the API.
