  "content": "# Path: /product/202309/brands\n# Method: [GET]\n# Function Description\nRetrieve all available brands for your shop, including the built-in brands and any custom brands created using the [Create Custom Brands API](650a0926f1fd3102b91bbfb0). Pass the returned brand ID when creating or editing a product to associate the brand with the product.\n\n* To check if a brand is fully authorized for use in a specific product category, specify the **category ID**.\n* To obtain the full list of brands that your shop can potentially use and their authorization status, omit the category ID. We recommend that you specify the **brand name** to narrow down the list of brands returned.\n   **Key concept**\n   Whether you can select and display a brand depends on the brand's authorization status, the categories authorized for the brand, and whether the brand is classified as T1 (internationally renowned brands that require prior brand authorization).\n   **- Brand selection rules**: You can only select the following types of brands during product creation/editing.\n   * Authorized brands which contain the desired category (`authorized_status=AUTHORIZED` and `brand_status=AVAILABLE`)\n   * Unauthorized non-T1 brands (`authorized_status=UNAUTHORIZED` and `is_t1_brand=false`)\n      **- Brand display rules**: Note however that brands will only appear on the product display page if the brand is authorized (`authorized_status=AUTHORIZED`) and available in the desired category (`brand_status=AVAILABLE`). This means that you need to obtain brand authorization for unauthorized non-T1 brands before they can be displayed. Obtain brand authorization or add categories to an authorized brand through TikTok Shop Seller Center > Qualification Center > Brand qualification.\n      **For Tokopedia sellers**: You can select and display any returned brand on Tokopedia regardless of these rules.\n\n\n---\n\n\n# Common Parameters\nFor common parameters, refer to [How to call TikTok Shop APIs - Common Parameters](https://partner.tiktokshop.com/docv2/page/64f199679495ef0281851ee5#Back%20To%20Top)\n| Properties <!-- width:110px --> | Location <!-- width:75px --> | Type <!-- width:75px --> | Require <!-- width:60px --> | Sample <!-- width:254px --> | Properties description <!-- width:254px --> |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| shop_cipher | query | string | Y | GCP_XF90igAAAABh00qsWgtvOiGFNqyubMt3 | Use this property to pass shop information in requesting the API.
