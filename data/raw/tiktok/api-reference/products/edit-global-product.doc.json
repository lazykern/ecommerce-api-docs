  "content": "# Path: /product/202309/global_products/{global_product_id}\n# Method: [PUT]\n# Function Description\nEdit all properties (e.g. description, brand, images, attributes) of a global product.\n**IMPORTANT**: For published products, the changes will be automatically retranslated and synced to all markets where the product is published. If you have already edited the product information or translations of the associated local products, they will be overwritten by the information in this API. For example, if you have customized the local prices such as the local pre-tax price or the local display price, they will be overwritten each time this API is called.\n**Note**:\n\n* There may be a limit to the number of products you can relist per day. We recommend prioritizing key products first to ensure they get published. You can find your listing limit on the Seller Center homepage.\n* All inputs, including blanks, in the request payload will overwrite existing values. To retain an existing value, make sure to include it in your request. Therefore, **it is strongly recommended to retrieve the latest product data using** [Get Global Product](6509e2b0bace3e02b7490c96) **and submit the complete data when editing**. This ensures accuracy and helps avoid errors or unintentional data loss due to missing fields.\n* The language used in the product content must align with the target market's language (e.g. don't use Chinese), otherwise the listing will fail or be rejected.\n\n\n---\n\n\n# Common Parameters\nFor common parameters, refer to [How to call TikTok Shop APIs - Common Parameters](https://partner.tiktokshop.com/docv2/page/64f199679495ef0281851ee5#Back%20To%20Top)\n| Properties <!-- width:110px --> | Location <!-- width:75px --> | Type <!-- width:75px --> | Require <!-- width:60px --> | Sample <!-- width:254px --> | Properties description <!-- width:254px --> |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| content-type | header | string | Y | application/json | Allowed type: application/json |\n# Request Path Parameters\n| Properties <!-- width:110px --> | Type <!-- width:90px --> | Require <!-- width:90px --> | Sample <!-- width:254px --> | Properties description <!-- width:254px --> |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| global_product_id | string | Y | 1729592969712207008 | The global product ID generated by TikTok Shop. |\n# Request Query Parameters\n| Properties <!-- width:110px --> | Type <!-- width:90px --> | Require <!-- width:90px --> | Sample <!-- width:254px --> | Properties description <!-- width:254px --> |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| app_key | string | Y | 38abcd | Every single app will have a unique key.
