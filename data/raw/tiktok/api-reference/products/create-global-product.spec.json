    "env_desc": "Create global products to be sold in one or multiple shops outside of the seller's base country.\nYou can only create global products in `AVAILABLE` product categories. For other categories, contact your account manager for assistance. After product creation, use the [Publish Global Product API](https://partner.tiktokshop.com/docv2/page/650a64d6defece02be678fd6) to publish and translate the product in the desired markets.\n**Key concept**: Global products are products created by cross-border sellers to be sold in shops outside of their base country. With global products, cross-border sellers operating across multiple markets can avoid creating the same product for each shop individually. Instead, they just need to create a single global product, which can be published and synced to all their shops, simplifying product management across markets.\n**Note**:\n- This API is applicable only for intra-EU sellers and global sellers. To create and list local products intended for sale exclusively in local shops, use the [Create Product API](https://partner.tiktokshop.com/docv2/page/6502fc8da57708028b42b18a) instead.\n- There may be a limit to the number of products you can list per day. We recommend prioritizing the creation of key products first to ensure they get published. You can find your listing limit on the Seller Center homepage.\n- The language used in the product content must align with the target market's language (e.g. don't use Chinese), otherwise the listing will fail or be rejected.",
