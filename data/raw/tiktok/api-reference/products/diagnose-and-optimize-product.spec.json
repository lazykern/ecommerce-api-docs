The returned information includes:\n- Listing quality information (available only for the US market).\n- Issues with the current product details and the overall recommendations\n- Auto-generated optimization suggestions targeted for specific product fields, including the title, description, and image.\nThis API enables you to diagnose both live products (status: `ACTIVATE`)  and brand-new products not yet listed in TikTok Shop.\n- To diagnose a **live product**, provide the `product_id` and `category_id` and leave all other product details blank.\n- To diagnose a **brand-new product** not yet listed in TikTok Shop, omit the `product_id` and provide the product details as necessary.\n- To diagnose a **product similar to an existing one**, provide the `product_id` and `category_id`, along with any new details. The diagnosis will combine the existing product's information with the new details you provide. For example, if you provide a new `title`, the diagnosis will use the new title instead of the existing one while keeping the other values from the product ID.\n**Note**: \n- To diagnose multiple live products, use the [Product Information Issue Diagnosis API](665048f380b6b302e73917d9).\n- This API focuses solely on optimizing product visibility and does not evaluate whether your product meets listing requirements. Quality issues identified by this API do not block your product from being listed. To verify listing requirements, use the [Check Product Listing API](650a0ee8f1fd3102b91c6493).",
