    "env_desc": "Edit some properties (e.g. description, images, attributes) of a product that is not in the `FREEZE` or `DELETED` state.\nAfter editing the product, the latest product content (referred to as v2) will be resent for audit review. If the audit passes, v2 is published to the shop, otherwise, the existing product stays live and remains unchanged (keeping v1). However, edits to the `price` or `inventory` fields do not require a reaudit and will be immediately published on the platform. Use the [Product status change](650956aff1fd3102b90b6261) webhook to keep track of the review status.\n**Note**: \n- This API is applicable for all sellers.\n- There may be a limit to the number of products you can relist per day. We recommend prioritizing key products first to ensure they get published. You can find your listing limit on the Seller Center homepage.\n- If a draft or audit-review version exists, unedited fields will retain their values over those of the base (live) version.\n- **Updates are handled per top-level property**, so all non-empty fields within an updated object must be supplied to prevent overwriting with blanks. For top-level properties (e.g. `description`, `brand_id`) that are not nested in an object, you can update them individually. Omitting these properties in the request will leave them unchanged. If you need to edit any nested property within an object, you must provide values for all nested properties of that object. Any omitted nested properties will be overwritten with blanks.\n- If new mandatory product attributes were added by TikTok Shop after the creation of your product, ensure that you provide these attributes too.\n**For global sellers**:\nIf you're using the local replication listing method, note the following sync rules:\n**Sales attribute changes** (in sales attribute id/name) must be synced to other markets. Therefore, you must provide the `seller_sku` and complete `replicated_products` data. The API call will fail if you don't provide these details.\n**New SKUs* (new sales attribute value id/name) are optional to sync to other markets. To sync, please provide the `seller_sku` and complete `replicated_products` data.\n**General changes** are optional to sync to other markets. To sync, you only need to provide `replicated_products.region`.\n**For Tokopedia sellers**:\nNote that a product can have **only one active version** across all platforms at any time. If a product is live on both platforms, audit results for the latest version are handled as follows:\n- **Mixed audit results**: If the product passes audit on one platform but fails on another, on the successful platform, the product will stay live and be updated with content from the latest version (v2), while on the failed platform, the product will be deactivated and hidden entirely.\n- **Audit failure on all platforms**: If the product fails audit on all platforms, the existing product stays live and remains unchanged (keeping v1).",
