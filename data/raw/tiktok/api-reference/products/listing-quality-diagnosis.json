Each diagnosis code corresponds to a specific recommendation and is assigned a quality tier, such as \"FAIR\" or \"GOOD\". Implementing the recommendations can help your listing progress through these tiers to achieve better quality and visibility. For example, a product will reach the \"GOOD\" tier once all \"FAIR\" and \"GOOD\" recommendations are addressed or implemented.\nFor more information about the listing quality tiers and criteria, refer to [Listing Quality Guidelines](https://seller-us.tiktok.com/university/essay?from=feature_guide&identity=1&knowledge_id=481891871868714&role=1).\n| **Quality tier**  <!-- width:100px --> | **Category**  <!-- width:130px --> | **Diagnosis code (`diagnosis_results.code`）**<!-- width:440px --> | **Recommendations** |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| FAIR | Description | DESCRIPTION_CHARACTERS_LESS_THAN_80_CHARS | Provide a description of at least 80 characters and/or add images. |\n| FAIR | Description | DESCRIPTION_INVALID | Avoid providing just a link.
