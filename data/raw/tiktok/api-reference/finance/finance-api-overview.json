Each seller has one statement per day. The statement will be generated every day (UTC 0:00), and will be closed at 0:00 the next day. After closing, the statement will be automatically issued and initiate payment. One statement corresponds to one payment. But in special cases (for example, when the settlement amount is too small and does not meet the payment requirements), multiple statements will combined as one payment.\n**Payments**: Records used to describe the transaction of payout funds. When payment is initiated, this document can be used as the basis for reconciliation with the bank account.\n\n![Image](https://p16-arcosite-va.ibyteimg.com/tos-maliva-i-10qhjjqwgv-us/eb49e5b7a4df450db870eb9f113ece72~tplv-10qhjjqwgv-image.image)\n\n\n![Image](https://p16-arcosite-va.ibyteimg.com/tos-maliva-i-10qhjjqwgv-us/087759034bd841a7a8ec237820805763~tplv-10qhjjqwgv-image.image)\n\n# Frequently Asked Questions \n## Why is an order not settled yet?\nPlease refer to the settlement rules on TikTok Shop Academy for your specific market.\n\n<br>\n\n## What are the adjustment types？\n| **Adjustment type** | **Description** |\n| --- | --- |\n| Shipping fee adjustment | Adjustment when there are differences or mistakes with the shipping fee paid by the seller. |\n| Shipping fee compensation | Compensation given to sellers due to differences between the actual shipping fee and the pre-paid shipping fee. |\n| Chargeback | The charge returned to a payment card after a customer has successfully disputed an item on their account statement or transactions report. |\n| Customer service compensation | This is extra compensation or compensation paid to a customer after the after-sales period by customer service. |\n| Promotion adjustment | Adjustment when a seller takes part in a platform promotion and there are differences between the promotion price and the actual amount paid by the seller. |\n| Platform compensation | Compensation paid to the seller as a result of the seller successfully appealing customer dispute. |\n| Platform penalty | After identifying a violation of platform policies, we have deducted the corresponding penalty amount from your account in accordance with our policies.
