You can only assign one sample rule for one `product_id`. Only the most recent API call will take effect. |\n| sample_rule | object | N |  | Sample rule |\n| ^sample_quota | int | N | 100 | The total quantity of the samples provided by the seller that the creators can apply for. |\n| ^is_sample_time_unlimited | bool | N | true | Whether the sample is always available for application: |\n\n* If true, the sample can be requested at any time.\n* If false, the sample can only be requested during specified time periods. You must set start_time and end_time. |\n   ^start_time |int |N |1728552553 |The start time of the period during which a creator can apply for samples. You must specify `start_time` and `end_time` together. |\n   ^end_time |int |N |1728552553 |The end time of the period during which a creator can apply for samples. You must specify `start_time` and `end_time` together. |\n   ^thresholds |object |N | |The threshold criteria that a creator must meet to be eligible to apply for the sample. |\n   ^^minimum_follower_count |int |N |2000 |The creator must have a follower count greater than this value to be eligible to request the sample. |\n   ^^minimum_gmv |int |N |1000 |The creator must have the GMV in the past 30 days greater than this value to be eligible to request the sample. |\n   ^^avg_ec_video_views |int |N |5 |The creator must have the average views of e-commerce videos in the past 30 days greater than this value to be eligible to request the sample. |\n   ^^category_ids |[]string |N |[\"601152\"] |A list of product first-level category IDs.\n   Use this to limit participating creators: for each creator, sort their GMV over the past 30 days by first-level product category. If the GMV of one of the categories is among the top three, the creator is eligible to participate in the event. No restriction by default.\n   For example, if a creator's top three categories are [{Cellphone_ID}, {Furniture_ID}, {Food_ID}], and the value of tehis parameter is `[{Food_ID}]`, the creator is qualified for open collaboration. |\n   ^^predicted_fulfillment_rank |string |N |LOW |The creators whose predicted rate of posting a shoppable video or LIVE after receiving a sample.\n* ALL. All creators regardless of the rate.\n* LOW. The creators whose rate is above or equal to low.\n* MEDIUM. The creators whose rate is above or equal to medium.\n* HIGH. The creators whose rate is high. |\n   ^activate_status |string |Y |ACTIVATE |To activate the sample rule, use `ACTIVATE`; to deactivate the sample rule, use `DEACTIVATE`.\n   When using `ACTIVATE`, you must specify the details of the rule; when using `DEACTIVATE`, you just need to specify `product_id`. |\n\n# Request Sample\n**Query**\n```Plain Text\nhttps://open-api.tiktokglobalshop.com/affiliate_seller/202410/open_collaborations/sample_rules?app_key=123abc&sign=5361235029d141222525e303d742f9e38aea052d10896d3197ab9d6233730b8c&timestamp=1625484268&shop_cipher=ROW_RHkDDABBAAB8tKAVoAqsMTjsQZFLyNfY\n```\n\n**Body**\n```json\n{\"product_id\":\"123456\",\"sample_rule\":{\"sample_quota\":100,\"is_sample_time_unlimited\":true,\"start_time\":1728552553,\"end_time\":1728552553,\"thresholds\":{\"minimum_follower_count\":2000,\"minimum_gmv\":1000,\"avg_ec_video_views\":5,\"category_ids\":[\"601152\"],\"predicted_fulfillment_rank\":\"LOW\"},\"activate_status\":\"ACTIVATE\"}}\n```\n\n# Response Parameters\n| Properties <!-- width:110px --> | Type <!-- width:90px --> | Sample <!-- width:289px --> | Properties description <!-- width:289px --> |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| code | int | 0 | The success or failure status code returned in API response. |\n| message | string | Success | The success or failure messages returned in API response.
