  "content": "Context\n\nThe Orders API helps you obtain information about orders.\nYou may programmatically GET an Order List, and GET the Order Details from a specific Order.\nAdditionally, you may also subscribe to the Order Status Webhook to be notified regarding order status changes.\n\nImportant Concepts\nOrder\n\nAn order is created when the buyer clicks on the Place Order button. Please note that when the order is created, the buyer has yet to make the payment, therefore the status of the order is UNPAID. Once an order is created, the seller should deduct or hold inventory from their inventory management system accordingly.\n\nOrder Structure\n\nOrder ID: An Order ID is a unique identifier for each Order that is created by a Buyer.\n\nSKU ID: An order line contains 1 or more items of products of the same Stock Keeping Unit. Each SKU is identified by its unique SKU ID. A SKU can be thought of as a \"variant\".\n\nOrder Line Item id: Each single item in a line is identified by its unique order line item id.\n\n\n\n\nExample- A buyer places an order for 5 products total: 2 Red Large T-shirts, 2 Red Medium T-shirts, and 1 size 10 black shoes:\n\nOrder\tSKU\tLine item\n\nOrder ID: 12345678\n\n\t\nRed Large T Shirt\n\t\n1x Red Large T Shirt (item 1)\n\n\n\t\n\t\n1x Red Large T Shirt (item 2)\n\n\n\t\nRed Medium t shirt\n\n\t\n1x Red Medium t shirt (item 3)\n\n\n\t\n\t\n1x Red Medium t shirt (item 4)\n\n\n\t\nSize 10 Black Shoes\n\t\n1 size 10 black shoes (item 5)\nOrder Status\nOrder Status Definition\nStatus\tDescription\n\nUNPAID\n\t\nThe order has been placed but payment has been authorized.\n\n\nON_HOLD\n\t\nAfter payment is completed for the order, the order transitions into the ON_HOLD status during the remorse period. The remorse period allows the buyer to cancel the order without seller approval. ON_HOLD orders are not allowed to be fulfilled.\n\n\nAWAITING_SHIPMENT\n\t\nAwaiting the seller to place a logistic order.\n\n\nPARTIALLY_SHIPPING\n\t\nOne or more (but not all) items in the order have been shipped.\n\n\nAWAITING_COLLECTION\n\t\nThe logistics order was placed. At least one item in the order is still waiting to be collected by the carrier.\n\n\nIN_TRANSIT\n\t\nAll items have been collected by the carrier. At least one package is has yet to be delivered to the buyer.\n\n\nDELIVERED\n\t\nAll items have been delivered to the buyer.\n\n\nCOMPLETED\n\t\nThe order has been completed. Completed orders can no longer be returned or refunded.\n\n\nCANCELLED\n\n\t\nThe order has been canceled. The order can be canceled by the buyer, the seller, the TikTok SYSTEM, or a TikTok OPERATOR.\n\n* Buyer: Buyers can change their mind and cancel within 1 hour post purchase, known as 1-hour remorse. Past this period, Buyer can still request a cancellation, but it is subject to Seller approval.\n* Seller: Sellers can cancel an order, for example if they are out of stock of the product.\n* SYSTEM: Orders may be cancelled by the TikTok system automatically based on TikTok policies. For example, this can happen if a package is lost in transit, and TikTok detects that the tracking ID has not progressed for over 7 days.\n* OPERATOR: Orders may also be cancelled by TikTok customer service for a variety of reasons.\n\nFor a comprehensive list of supported cancellation reasons, please visit this page.\nOrder Status Transitions\nFrom UNPAID to ON_HOLD\nTrigger: When the order is paid, the order status updates to ON_HOLD.\nTrigger initiator: Buyer\nNote:\nFor ON_HOLD orders, the recipient address and buyer information are not available via the Order API.\nCurrently, the ON_HOLD status is only available in the US & UK market.\nFrom ON_HOLD to AWAITING_SHIPMENT\nTrigger: After the remorse window(1 hour after payment), the order status changes to AWAITING_SHIPMENT.\nTrigger initiator: TiKTok\nNote: This step occurs automatically.\nFrom AWAITING_SHIPMENT to PARTIALLY_SHIPPING\nTrigger: When some item(s) in the order but not all have been shipped.\nTrigger initiator: Seller\nNote: only split shipments have this status.

In this model, the seller is responsible for storing, packaging, and shipping the products to customers.\nFULFILLMENT_BY_TIKTOK: The seller stocks their products in Tiktok's fulfillment centers. Tiktok is responsible for storing, picking, packing, and shipping the products to customers.\nShipping type\n\nFor FULFILLMENT_BY_SELLER, there are two shipping types:\n\nTikTok Shipping: Tiktok provides shipping services. The seller obtains shipping labels from Tiktok.\n\nSeller Shipping: The seller arranges shipping.\n\nRecipient Address\nRecipient Information Redaction\n\nIn the following scenarios, the recipient's address and personal information will be redacted.\n\nOrder fulfillment_type = FULFILLMENT_BY_TIKTOK\nOrder fulfillment_type = FULFILLMENT_BY_SELLER and shipping type = TikTok\nLocalized Recipient Address\n\nDifferent countries may have different address hierarchy and naming conventions. To accommodate such differences, use 'district_info_list' to obtain address information expressed in the local address hierarchy and naming convention.\n\nOrder SLA (Service Level Agreement) Information\n\nCurrently, Tiktok shop has the following Service Level Agreement concept.\nrts_sla: \"RTS\" is the abbreviation for Ready To Ship. RTS marks the time when the order status transitions to AWAITING_COLLECTION. rts_sla indicates the time period within which TikTok requires the seller to ship the order. If the order status has not transitioned to AWAITING_COLLECTION before rts_sla has passed, this constitutes a late dispatch, which will increase the seller's late dispatch rate.\ntts_sla: \"TTS\" stands for Transfer To Ship. TTS marks the time when the order status transitions to IN_TRANSIT. tts_sla specifies the time period within which TikTok requires the packages to be collected by the carrier. If the order status has not transitioned to IN_TRANSIT before tts_sla has passed, this constitutes a late dispatch, which will increase the seller's late dispatch rate.\ndelivery_sla: The time period within which TikTok requires the packages to be delivered to the buyer.\ncancel_order_sla: If the seller fails to complete the shipment by this time point, the order will be automatically canceled by the platform. TikTok might cancel the order, if the order doesn't arrange the shipment before rts_sla or the order can not obtain the tracking information before tts_sla. Policy details, please see the Seller Academy.\n\nTikTok Shop Marketplace Policies\n\nAs a Marketplace, TikTok Shop imposes certain policies on sellers for the benefit of both buyers and sellers.\n\nCancel Policy\n\nBuyer cancel order within 1-hour:\n\nBuyers are able to cancel their order within one hour for no charge: this is known as the 1-hour remorse period. This is required for all shops. We simply recommend that sellers wait one hour before beginning fulfillment of the Order, and for all apps and services to implement this 1-hour remorse period. In the US & UK market, this 1-hour remorse window is ON_HOLD status.\n\nBuyer request cancel after 1-hour:\n\nAfter 1-hour, buyer cancel request required to review by seller. The seller can accept or decline the cancel request.\n\nOrder Fulfillment SLA(Service Level Agreement) Policy\nThe seller should arrange shipment before rts_sla time.\nThe shipping service provider must update the tracking information of package collection before the tts_sla time.\nIf the Seller is not able to fulfill an Order with a valid shipping ID before cancel_order_sla, the Order will be cancelled and the Buyer refunded.\nFrequently Asked Questions\nHow do I get order ID from?\nTo utilize the Orders API, you must subscribe to the Orders Webhook.
