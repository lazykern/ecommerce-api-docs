  "content": "Context\n\nCustomer Service refers to the communication channel used by the customer service of the sellers and buyers to communicate information about the whole process of pre-sale, in-sale and after-sale.\nOnce the integration is done using Customer Service API, the messages from your TikTok Shop buyers will be forwarded to third party customer support system. This eliminates the need to log in to Seller Center to manage buyer messages, and allows customer service agents to reply to messages directly on their Customer support platform. This article is applicable to Third-party Independent Service Vendors (hereinafter referred to as ISV) or self-developed merchants who access the TiKTok Shop Customer Service functions.\n\nCustomer Service is available in TTSPC as custom API.\n\nCustomer Service is a custom API available in TTSPC, visible to partners/ ISVs who have selected Customer Service as the business category in 'Category & Market' and service category in 'app or service'.\nCustomer Service API is inactive by default and the partner/ ISV has to apply for access, which requires approval from your Account Manager or Partner Manager to activate the API to build applications.\n\nRead more\n\nSellers can authorize third-party software or systems to use the Customer Service open interface to obtain Customer Service data and functions through the authorization page of the workbench.\nThe Customer Service open interface will provide capabilities including: Customer Service session list, session status, sending pictures, etc., and support merchants to receive and reply to consumer TTS Customer Service messages on third-party systems.\n\nWith the Customer Service API you can build applications that send messages to buyers, obtaining session lists, session messages, new event hooks, obtaining and setting customer service agent status. You can get a list of message types that are available for an order that you specify, then call the operation that creates a new conversation to send a message to the buyer for that order. By integrating Customer Service Open API with your third party systems, you will centralize your customer support efforts, maintain better control over communication and provide consistent experience for your customers.\n\nSeller Side Overview\n\nNOTE: Please refer to the Developer Guide before integration for complete platform onboarding and app creation, and understand api call & authorization notice.\n\nCustomer Service API Operations and Webhooks\nOperations\n\nGet Conversation Messages\n\n\nGet Conversations\n\n\nSend Message\n\n\nGet Agent Settings\n\n\nUpdate Agent Settings\n\n\nUpload Buyer Messages Image\n\n\nRead Message\n\n\nCreate Conversation\n\n\nWebhooks\n\n\nNew Conversation\n\n\nNew Message\nImportant Concepts\n\nConversation - A conversation is an exchange between the buyer and the shop. Conversations can occur in real-time and across channels when necessary, but can be picked back up without losing context or history. A conversation can be started with a message and it can have threaded messages.\nMessage - A message is a single instance of communication between the buyer and the seller.\n\nChat message response window for conversation auto-close.\n\nIn a chat conversation, if the buyer does not reply, the conversation will be closed after 6 hours.\n\nThe seller customer service has 7 days to respond to a chat message. If customer service does not reply, the conversation is auto-closed for non-response.\n\nTo initiate a conversation with a buyer, one of the following three criteria must be satisfied:\n\nThere should have been a prior conversation between the buyer and the shop within the last 30 days.\n\nThe buyer should have placed an order at the shop within the past 60 days.\n\nThe buyer should have a history of returns or refunds at the shop.\n\nDefinition of roles in \"Particpant\"\t\n\nBUYER\n\t\nThe buyer communicates with the seller by sending a message on the TikTok messaging app.\n\n\nSHOP\n\t\nThe shop is the seller business owner on TikTok marketplace. Shop is the main account which also has the customer service role. The owner account is the only one supported in the Customer Service API for integration with CS partners.\n\n\nCUSTOMER_SERVICE\n\t\nThe customer support agent of the seller who is assigned to the conversation. If a seller has multiple customer service agents, then their conversations are passed as the main account to the buyer by the Customer Service API.\n\n\nExample scenarios:\n\t\n\nWhen the buyer starts a conversation, 2 participants are in this group chat: the BUYER and the SHOP.\n\nIf there is customer service serving this customer, there will be 3 members: BUYER, SHOP and CUSTOMER SERIVCE.\n\nOnce this conversation is done, the CUSTOMER_SERVICE will leave the group chat.\n\nDefinition of roles in \"Sender\"\t\n\nBUYER\n\t\nindicates that the message is sent by buyer.\n\n\nCUSTOMER_SERVICE\n\t\nindicates that the message is sent by agent\n\n\nSHOP\n\t\nAuto-Reply and FAQs are sent via the Shop.\n\n\nSYSTEM\n\t\nindicates this message is a system message. Normally this kind of message will be sent via the user \"SHOP\", and the sender is marked as \"SYSTEM\", to indicate that this message is a \"system message\".\n\n\nROBOT\n\t\nWhen the seller enables \"Chat Bot\" in seller center, some auto-reply may be triggered once the buyer has entered some kind of questions. This kind of message will be sent via user \"SHOP\" or \"CUSTOMER_SERVICE\", and the sender is marked as \"ROBOT\", to indicate that this message is triggered by our smart tools\nCustomer Service user identifiers\t\n\nim_user_id\n\t\nThis is the internal Customer Service participant ID.\nThis ID can not be used to query orders. For querying orders, use buyer_user_id instead.\n\n\nbuyer_user_id\n\t\nThis is the buyer's user ID.\nUser_id in Customer Service API is the same as the buyer_user_id in Order API. You can fetch orders of a buyer who reached out to you via chat using \"buyer_user_id.\" Please use buyer_user_id to query for buyers in any external domain.\nTikTok Shop Marketplace Policies\n\nIt is very important to reply to buyer's messages in a timely manner. We recommend that sellers reply to buyers within 24 hours because replying to messages promptly:\n\nallows sellers to resolve any doubts that customers may have and improves customers' willingness to buy, improve conversion rates.\n\nhelps customers get a better understanding of products, reducing the likelihood of returns or refunds.\n\nleads to customer satisfaction with shop service and reduces the number of complaints.\n\nKey Performance Indicators and Targets\nWe encourage sellers to have direct, professional, and efficient communication when responding to customers. All the messages sent through TikTok Shop's Buyer Messages must comply with the response times set out in this policy. Sellers should note that TikTok Shop will evaluate them based on their customer service response time.\nAny customer queries that are handled by TikTok Shop will not impact seller performance metrics. Only tickets that are routed to sellers will be used to calculate a seller's performance.\nThe table below outlines the response time sellers must abide by when responding to customers.\n\n\tMetric\tDefinition\tSeller Target\n\nSeller Response Efficiency\n\t\n24-Hour response rate\n\t\nNumber of chats responded within 24 hours/Total number of chats received (over the last 30 calendar days)\n\t\n≥80%\n\n\n\t\nResolution Rate\n\t\nNumber of Chats marked as resolved / Total number of chats received (over the last 30 calendar days)\n\t\n≥65%\n\n\nCustomer Satisfaction\n\t\nCustomer Satisfaction Rating\n\t\nNumber of chats with ratings of 4 and 5 / Total chats that received ratings (over the last 30 calendar days)\n\n\t\n≥75%\n\n\nReview the TikTok Shop customer service policy at TikTok academy here.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\nWhen can Seller Customer Support initiate a new conversation with a buyer?\n\nSellers can reach out to buyers who have ordered from them.\nTo initiate a conversation with a buyer, one of the following three criteria must be satisfied:\n\nThere should have been a prior conversation between the buyer and the shop within the last 30 days.\n\nThe buyer should have placed an order at the shop within the past 60 days.\n\nThe buyer should have a history of returns or refunds at the shop.\n\nWhat message types are supported in TTS Customer Service API?\nMessage type\tCustomer Service API Support\tDescription\n\nText\n\t\nYes\n\t\nNo more than 2000 characters\n\n\nImage\n\t\nYes\n\t\nUpto 10 MB\n\n\nemoji (static)\n\t\nYes\n\t\n\n\nemoji (animation)\n\t\nNot supported\n\t\n\n\nVideo\n\t\nNot supported\n\t\nDisplay-supported; Send-not supported\n\n\nProduct card\n\t\nYes\n\t\nProduct ID\n\n\nOrder card\n\t\nYes\n\t\nOrder ID\n\n\nLogistic card\n\t\nNot supported\n\t\n\n\nOrder Return card\n\t\nNot supported\n\t\n\n\nVoucher card\n\t\nNot supported\n\t\n\n\nFAQ Card\n\t\nNot supported\n\t\n\n\nHyperlinks\n\t\nNot supported\n\t\n\n\nAttachments\n\t\nNot Supported\n\t\nWhat are some of the gaps between Customer Service API and TTS Seller Center.\nFeature\tTTS Shop Chat\tCustomer Service API\n\tNote on Customer Service API\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\nSend messages\n\t\n✅\n\t\n✅\n\t\n\n\nList conversation\n\t\n✅\n\t\n✅\n\t\n\n\nGet conversation messages\n\t\n✅\n\t\n✅\n\t\nGet messages by messageID and conversation details by ConversationID supported in Customer Service API V3.0\n\n\nCustomer status\n\t\n✅\n\t\n✅\n\t\n\n\nUpdate customer status\n\t\n✅\n\t\n✅\n\t\n\n\nAgent Work Status\n\t\n✅\n\t\n✅\n\t\n\n\nCustomer Service Hook\n\n* New Conversation Started\n* New Message Received\n* sender id/sender role/message\n\t\n✅\n\t\n✅\n\t\n\n\nMark Read\n\t\n✅\n\t\n✅\n\t\n\n\nStart new conversation with Buyer\n\t\n✅\n\t\n✅\n\t\n\n\nSmart Tools\n\t\n✅\n\t\n❌\n\t\n\n\nChat details\n\t\n✅\n\t\n❌\n\t\n\n\nChat Assistant\n\t\n✅\n\t\n❌\n\t\nCS Platforms may have their own or may prefer to use their own Chatbot/FAQ.\n\n\nAdd Notes\n\t\n✅\n\t\n❌\n\t\n\n\nCustomer satisfaction review\n\t\n✅\n\t\n❌\n\t\nBuyer satisfaction data is calculated by TTS and available in Seller Center.\n\n\nFAQ and Auto Reply\n\t\n✅\n\t\n❌\n\t\n\"FAQ and Auto Reply\" has to be configured and enabled by Sellers in TTS first to be used in Chat API.

Additionally, they can set up message integration through third-party customer service platforms like Salesforce, Zendesk, or Gorgias, which utilize email-to-case or similar functions. This means that buyer messages will be compiled and sent to sellers via email, and sellers can respond directly to the email, with the buyer receiving the response within TikTok.\nRead more\n\nIs service data supported in the Customer Service API?\n\nService data is currently not supported in the Customer Service API.\nService data refers to the personal data of this customer service agent.\n\n24h response rate: The number of chats inquired by customers responded within 24 hours divided by the total number of chats inquired by customers within the last 7 days.\n\nSatisfaction rate: the satisfaction of buyers served by customer service today, the formula = the number of sessions that customers evaluated as 'satisfied' and 'very satisfied' divided by the number of sessions that buyers have evaluated.\n\nSessions today: The number of sessions initiated by consumers allocated to this customer service today.\n\nCurrent support shows msg type\nmsg type\tis support\n\ntext\n\t\nYes\n\n\nfile_image\n\t\nYes\n\n\nallocated_service\n\t\nYes\n\n\nnotification\n\t\nYes\n\n\nuser_enter_from_transfer\n\t\nYes\n\n\nuser_enter_from_goods\n\t\nYes\n\n\nuser_enter_from_order\n\t\nYes\n\n\ngoods_card\n\t\nYes\n\n\nemoticons\n\t\nYes\n\n\norder_card\n\t\nYes\n\n\nvideo\n\t\nYes\n\n\ninvite_comment_v2\n\t\nNo\n\n\ncard\n\t\nNo\n\n\ninteractive_system_message\n\t\nNo\n\n\ncard_greeting\n\t\nNo\n\n\nmessage_greeting_question_answer\n\t\nNo\n\n\nmessage_greeting_question\n\t\nNo\n\n\nmessage_greeting_question_answer_image\n\t\nNo\n\n\norder_reverse_card\n\t\nNo\n\n\nsystem_button\n\t\nNo\n\n\nselect_order\n\t\nNo\n\n\norder_logistics_card\n\t\nNo",
