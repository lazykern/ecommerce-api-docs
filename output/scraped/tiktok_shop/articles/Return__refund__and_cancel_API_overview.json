  "content": "Context\n\nCancel/Return/Refund, also referred to as 'post-transaction' or 'after-sales' can be initiated by a buyer or directly processed by a seller. TikTok Shop provides two APIs for sellers process these after-sales situations. The cancel API allows sellers to process a buyer order cancellation request as well as a direct seller order cancellation. The return API allows sellers to process a buyer order refund/ return & refund request. For situations where TikTok Shop cancels/ refunds an order, please refer to TikTok Shop Seller Academy for details.\n\n\nCancel order: Order cancellations can be initiated by a buyer after the buyer remorse window or directly canceled by the seller. For each canceled order, there is a buyer/seller cancel reason, cancel status, cancel order creation time, and the seller's process time for the buyer cancellation request. In the US and UK markets, TikTok Shop allows sellers to process partial order cancellations on item out of stock scenario.\n\n\nReturn order: Return orders refers to when a buyer requests to return or refund one or more items from an order. Returns can be initiated by a buyer after they have received the items. Return orders contain the buyer/seller return or refund reason, return/refund status, return or refund request time, the seller's process time for the buyer return/refund request, and the refund amount.\n\n\nThere are 2 ways to implement Search Cancel API and Search Return API:\n\nSubscribe to the Cancellation Status Change and Return Status Change webhooks: you must subscribe to reverse order Webhook.

For example, this can happen if a package is lost in transit, and TikTok Shop detects that the tracking number has not changed for over 7 days.\n\nOPERATOR: Orders may also be cancelled by TikTok Shop's customer service for a variety of reasons.\n\nCancel\n\nOrder Cancellations: This API allows sellers to cancel paid orders as well as manage order cancellation requests. Please note, only orders that have not yet been shipped can be canceled.\n\n\nNote: Buyers cannot cancel individual line items within multiple line item orders. Currently, only US and UK sellers are allowed to do partial cancel on item out of stock scenario.\n\n\nCancel Types: On the TikTok Shop platform, there are two types of order cancellations on TikTok Shop: buyer initiated cancellation, i.e. BUYER_CANCEL and direct cancellation, i.e. CANCEL. Seller/System/Operator can direct cancel an order. BUYER_CANCEL requires the seller to review the cancellation request. If an order's status is 'ON_HOLD', and a buyer initiates a cancellation, TikTok Shop will accept the cancellation request on behalf of the seller automatically. The seller does not need to review the cancellation request. In this case, this order will have a 'CANCEL' cancellation type.\n\n\nCancellation Reasons: Please refer to our list of cancel reasons.\n\n\nCancellation Order Status：\n\nBusiness Case:\n\nBuyer initiates a cancellation request\n\nSeller initiates a cancellation\n\nRefund\n\nRefund: Buyers/Seller are able to initiate a refund for a line item.
