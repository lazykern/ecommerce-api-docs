This helps sellers refine their messaging strategies over time. To link tasks with messages, you must assign the relevant task ID when sending the messages.\nA task can be used for both one-time and ongoing automated messaging, and multiple recipients can be targeted within a single API call by assigning the relevant buyer's email when sending the messages. Note that each task has a mandatory end time, and once expired, it cannot be used to send additional messages.\n\nTikTok Instant Messaging (IM)\n\nEngagement messages are sent to buyers through TikTok Instant Messaging, which is located in the TikTok App > Inbox > TikTok Shop > [Shop Name].\n\nMessage Template\n\nTikTok Shop offers a library of predefined message templates which you can use directly in your customer engagement communications. These templates are categorized into various scenarios, allowing sellers to select from them based on their preferences.
