After which, you can use Get Product API (v202309) to retrieve a product's existing property values (including its listing quality tier) and pinpoint the ones that need to be edited.\n\nDiagnosis results and recommendations\n\nThe diagnosis is performed on the following product fields:\n- Title: The product title (API property: title)\n- Description: The product description (API property: description)\n- Attributes: The product attributes (API property: product_attributes or skus.sales_attributes)\n- Size chart: The size chart image (API property: size_chart)\n- Product images: The product images displayed in the image gallery (API property: main_images)\n\nRefer to the following region-based tables for the diagnosis results/codes returned in the APIs and the actionable recommendations to optimize your listings effectively.\nNote: Codes marked as \"Retired\" indicate that they are no longer recommended and will not appear anymore.\n\nUnited States\n\nIn the US, product listings are evaluated based on a tiered system that includes listing quality tiers such as \"POOR\", FAIR\", and \"GOOD\". Each diagnosis code corresponds to a specific recommendation and is assigned a quality tier, such as \"FAIR\" or \"GOOD\". Implementing the recommendations can help your listing progress through these tiers to achieve better quality and visibility. For example, a product will reach the \"GOOD\" tier once all \"FAIR\" and \"GOOD\" recommendations are addressed or implemented.\nFor more information about the listing quality tiers and criteria, refer to Listing Quality Guidelines.\n\nQuality tier\tCategory\tDiagnosis code (diagnosis_results.code）\tRecommendations\n\nFAIR\n\t\nAttributes\n\n\t\n(Retired) ATTRIBUTE_MISSING_REQUIRED_ITEM\n\n\t\nProvide the required product attributes.
