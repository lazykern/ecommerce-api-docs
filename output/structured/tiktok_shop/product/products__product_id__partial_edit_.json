  "description": "Edit a subset of the product properties (e.g. description, brand, images, attributes).​ After editing the product, the latest product content (referred to as v2) will be resent for audit review. If the audit passes, v2 is published to the shop, otherwise, the existing product stays live and remains unchanged (keeping v1). However, edits to the price or inventory fields do not require a reaudit and will be immediately published on the platform. Use the Product status change webhook to keep track of the review status.​ Note: ​ - This API is applicable only for local sellers and intra-EU sellers.​ - There may be a limit to the number of products you can relist per day. We recommend prioritizing key products first to ensure they get published. You can find your listing limit on the Seller Center homepage.​ - Updates are handled per top-level property, so all non-empty fields within an updated object must be supplied to prevent overwriting with blanks. For top-level properties (e.g. description, brand_id) that are not nested in an object, you can update them individually. Omitting these properties in the request will leave them unchanged. If you need to edit any nested property within an object, you must provide values for all nested properties of that object. Any omitted nested properties will be overwritten with blanks. For example, if you want to update identifier_code.code, you must also include the identifier_code.type property to avoid data loss for that property.​ - If new mandatory product attributes were added by TikTok Shop after the creation of your product, ensure that you provide these attributes too.​ For Tokopedia sellers:​ Note that a product can have only one active version across all platforms at any time. If a product is live on both platforms, audit results for the latest version are handled as follows:​ - Mixed audit results: If the product passes audit on one platform but fails on another, on the successful platform, the product will stay live and be updated with content from the latest version (v2), while on the failed platform, the product will be deactivated and hidden entirely.​ - Audit failure on all platforms: If the product fails audit on all platforms, the existing product stays live and remains unchanged (keeping v1).​ Version\n202309\n  \nAPI Testing Tool\n​",
