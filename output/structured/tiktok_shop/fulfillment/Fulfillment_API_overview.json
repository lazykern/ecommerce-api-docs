  "content": "Context\n\nThe Fulfillment API allows sellers to fulfill TikTok Shop orders.\n\nTikTok Shop offers two types of fulfillment types:\n\nFulfilled by TikTok (FULFILLMENT_BY_TIKTOK): TikTok will automatically process the order on behalf of the seller. The seller does not need to manage the fulfillment process.\nFulfilled by Seller (FULFILLMENT_BY_SELLER): Under this Fulfillment Type, there are two shipping types:\n\na) TikTok shipping (TIKTOK): Sometimes also referred to as \"platform shipping\" or \"shipped via platform.\" With this shipping type, the seller purchases shipping labels through TikTok Shop, and schedules a pick-up from a TikTok Shop carrier, or drops off parcels at the TikTok Shop carriers' drop-off locations. The seller can obtain the shipping type from Get Order Detail or Get Order List.\n\nb) Seller shipping (SELLER): Sometimes also referred to as \"shipped via seller.\" The seller manages shipping through their own channel(s). With this shipping type, the sellers call the Fulfillment API to provide shipping details back to TikTok Shop. The seller can obtain shipping type from Get Order Detail or Get Order List.\n\nThe Fulfillment API also offers both split-package and consolidated-package (sometimes also referred to as combined package) shipment options to support more flexible shipping needs. The seller can obtain fulfillment type from Get Order Detail or Get Order List.\n\nAvailable markets\n\nCurrently, fulfillment API flows are supported in the following markets (denoted ISO 3166, two-letter abbreviations will be used for the rest of the document):\n\nNorth America\nUnited States (US)\nEast Asia\nJapan (JP)\nSoutheast Asia (SEA)\nIndonesia (ID)\nThailand (TH)\nSingapore (SG)\nMalaysia (MY)\nVietnam (VN)\nPhillipines (PH)\nEurope (EMEA)\nUnited Kingdom (UK)\nSpain (ES)\nIreland (IE)\nGermany (DE)\nFrance (FR)\nItaly (IT)\nLatin America (LATAM)\nBrazil (BR)\nMexico (MX)\nImportant concepts\nPackage\nUS market\n\nIn the US market, a package is generated after the seller completes the shipment by calling one of the ship order APIs (Mark Package As Shipped/Create Packages/Schedule Package Handover) successfully. The items included in the package are specified by the seller when calling said APIs. The package_id will be returned in the response parameters in Mark Package As Shipped/Create Packages APIs.\n\nNon-US market (SEA, EMEA, LATAM)\n\nIn the SEA, EMEA, and LATAM markets, a package is generated after the buyer pays the order. The package includes all item(s) within the order. The package_id will be returned in the response parameters in Get Order Detail.\n\nFulfillment\nFulfillment types\n\nFULFILLMENT_BY_TIKTOK: The seller does not need to call any Fulfillment APIs to arrange fulfillment.
