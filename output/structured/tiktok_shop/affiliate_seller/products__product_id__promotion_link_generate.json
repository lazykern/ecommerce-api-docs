This API is used to generate affiliate exclusive product link based on all open collaboration products available within the TikTok Shop Affiliate Product Marketplace. This API generates a link, at the product ID level (which belongs to a Seller). This link, can be distributed to creators, by the partner developer(the user of this API). The creator adds this product to the creators' showcase through this url. This link, represents an affiliate partner's ability to bring higher matchmaking effectiveness on behalf of a seller. If a creator does indeed add the product to showcase through this link, then the downstream consumer purchases will be able to be attributed to this partner due to the link generation capabilities.
