  "description": "Optimize images used in your TikTok Shop by changing the background to white. This is especially useful for images displayed in the product image gallery as it enhances product visibility.  Note:  - The images to be optimized must first be uploaded to TikTok Shop through the Upload Product Image API. You will not be able to optimize any images that are not hosted by TikTok Shop. - Images that were previously optimized will not be processed again. - The optimization is processed asynchronously and typically completes within a few seconds. Therefore, the optimize_status returned in the first API request for an image is always PROCESSING, indicating that optimization is underway. Please call the API again after a few seconds to get the final optimization status. Version\n202404\n  \nAPI Testing Tool",
