    "content": "Context\n\nUse the Seller API to retrieve to the seller's active shop(s) or check if the seller has permission to manage global products. Our APIs help Selling Partner's extend their services and grow seller businesses on TikTok Shop at scale.\nThis API is currently commonly used by global sellers to check whether the store has the ability to list global products.\nThe Seller API helps allows you to programmatically GET an active shop(s) List, and Query whether you have the permission to list global products.\n\nImportant Concepts\nSeller(Object): In the TikTok Shop platform, the seller object represents an entity or account that represents a seller or merchant who offers products or services for sale on the platform. It typically contains information related to the seller's identity, profile, and settings.\nSeller-shop relationship\n\nShop states\n\nThe shop state mechanism in an e-commerce platform refers to the system used to manage and maintain the current state or status of a seller's shop or store on the platform. It involves tracking various aspects of the shop's operations, availability, and visibility to both sellers and buyers.\n\n\nShop region\n\nThe shop region in an e-commerce platform refers to the geographical or jurisdictional area where a seller's shop operates or targets its customers. It helps determine the availability, shipping options, and other localized aspects of the shop's services.\n\nTikTok Shop Marketplace Policies\n\nAs a Marketplace, TikTok Shop imposes certain policies on sellers to the benefit of both buyers and sellers.\n\nWe support global sellers opening 1 shop for each target selling country.\n\nFor local sellers, since the target sales place can only be sold locally, a seller can only open and operate 1 local shop.\n\nEvery seller has a unique shop code and seller ID generated by the platform. Both seller code and ID cannot be modified once created.\n\nEvery seller needs to complete the registration and submit the onboarding information, after approved by onboarding moderation, the seller can start business in the TikTok Shop, which means the shop state is active.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\nWhat are the different types of sellers?\n\nLocal sellers: Sellers who sell products within the same country as their registered business entity, and are not involved in import and export trades.\n\nGlobal sellers: Sellers who sell products to multiple countries beyond the country of their registered business entity. They engage in cross-border trade activities, including settlement and logistics.\n\nIntra-EU sellers: Sellers whose business entity is registered in one EU country and who sell products to customers in other EU countries.\n\nWhat's a Global product?\n\nGlobal products are applicable to the global sellers and intra-EU sellers only, local sellers cannot use this feature. In order to improve the efficiency in managing multi-shop products, sellers can manage product information centrally via this global product and apply changes to the product in multiple markets. After uploading global products, sellers can publish them to shops in multiple markets with just one click."

Using the Product API, a seller can create, edit, delete products, and retrieve product details, as well as sync them into Tiktok Shop from an external DTC/OMS/ERP system (such as Shopify) for sales on TikTok Shop.\nA product can be created either as a live product or a draft via Create Product API.\nThe steps to create a product varies based on the location of the shop.\n\nFor EU countries\n\n\n\n\n\nFor other regions\n\nProducts may be deactivated or frozen by TikTok for various policy violations. You can obtain the real-time review result of the product via the Product webhook.\nProduct details can be retrieved via the Get Product List API and the Get Product Detail API. Product details include product basic information and sales terms. Basic information includes item titles, description, inventory, images, etc. Sales terms include price and inventory, etc.\nA product will be reviewed by TikTok after the product is created or edited. If a live product fails the review after being edited, the live version remains the snapshot of the product before the editing. To retrieve the after-editing version being reviewed, specify True for the need_audit_version parameter field when calling the Get Product Detail API.\n\nImportant Concepts\n\nProduct: A product is an item that a seller lists on TikTok for sale. A product is identified by its unique product ID.\nCategory: Products on TikTok are grouped into categories predefined by TikTok. All products must belong to a category. Categories are organized in a tree structure. You can retrieve all available categories via Get Category API.\nAttribute: Attributes are supplementary content of product information. Attributes are associated with categories. For a particular category, some attributes are required while others are optional. Attributes can be further divided into product attributes and sales attributes.\n\nProduct attributes are general attributes such as manufacturer, country of origin, materials used)\nSales attributes are attributes that are specific to the variant (aka SKU) of a product such as size, color, length.\nCustom attributes are attributes that a seller can optionally create to supplement the product information. For example, weight is generally a generic product attribute, which is primarily used for shipping calculations. However, if your product is an extremely lightweight product for example performance outdoor clothing, you can list the weight as a custom attribute.\n\nProduct Status: A product has the following statuses:\n\n#\tStatus\tDefinition\n\n1\n\t\nDraft\n\n\t\nA product in the Draft status is not visible to TikTok Shop users. The seller may need to create a product in Draft mode, then supplement further product information before activating the product for sale.\n\n\n2\n\t\nPending\n\t\nA product is in the Pending status when it is being reviewed by TikTok.\n\n\n3\n\t\nFailed\n\t\nA product is in the Failed status if the product fails the review by TikTok.\n\n\n4\n\t\nActivate\n\n\t\nA product in the Activate status is visible to TikTok Shop users and available for purchase. A product can be live, but out of stock, which will not be available for purchase.\n\n\n5\n\t\nSeller_deactivated\n\t\nThe product has been deactivated by the seller. This removes the product from the shelf and from visibility to consumers. You can reactivate this product at any time.\n\n\n6\n\t\nPlatform_deactivated\n\n\t\nThe product has been deactivated by TikTok. The seller may edit the product information and re-submit for review, which will put the product into the Pending status.\n\n\n7\n\t\nFreeze\n\n\t\nThe product has been frozen by TikTok for violating TikTok Shop policies. TikTok Shop policies vary by region. The seller may appeal to unfreeze a frozen product. Once unfrozen, the product will be put back into the Platform_deactivated status.\n\n\n8\n\t\nDeleted\n\t\nThe seller has deleted the product. All historical data, including purchases, financial reports...etc will be removed from the platform. Only delete a product if you are 100% sure that you will no longer be selling the product and you have completed all internal reporting/financial analysis.\nTikTok Shop Marketplace Policies\n\nBrand authorization: TikTok requires the seller of a product to provide brand authorization for certain brands either as the direct manufacturer or an authorized reseller. Branded products without valid brand authorization cannot be listed on TikTok for sale. To verify whether the seller has authorization for a particular brand, use the Get Brand API.\nProduct certification: For certain categories, product certification is required to prove the authenticity of the product. These certifications are meant to comply with local laws. Some examples include ingredients in beauty or consumable products.\nProduct upload limit: To assist new sellers with order fulfillment, all new shops (both individual and corporate) on TikTok Shop are subject to a probation period that limits the number of daily orders sellers can accept and the number of product uploads sellers can list per day.\n\nNew individual sellers are limited to 100 orders per day.\nNew corporate sellers are limited to 200 orders per day.\nAll new sellers are limited to 100 product uploads per day.\n\nOnce sellers graduate from probation, sellers are not subject to order limits but are limited to 1,000 product uploads per day.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\n- I can't get my product to list. What is going on?\n\nThere are several reasons for this. Please check the following:\n\nYour product has all the required attributes.\n\nYour product has all the required certifications, based on the category it is assigned.\n\nYou have reached your 100 product upload limit per day, as a new Seller. Please try again the next day.\n\n- How do I overcome the Product Upload limit?\n\nNew sellers are limited to 100 products per day. If you would like to overcome this limit and graduate from new seller probation, please reach out to your TikTok account manager.\n\n- My product continuously fails TikTok reviews. Help!\n\nCheck that your images are high quality.\n\nCheck that your category or product is allowed for sale in the region.\n\nCheck that you have filled in all required product attributes.\n\nIf the above is not resolved, please reach out to your TikTok Account Manager.\n\n- What is the difference between Deactivate and Delete?\n\nDeactivate will temporarily remove your product off the shelf. All back-end data, including sales, reports, product description, will persist. You can reactivate this product at any time, when you receive more inventory etc.\nDeleting a product will remove the product from your catalog forever. This also removes historical sales data, financial settlements...etc. Only do this if you have tied up all your accounting and reporting matters, and are fully committed to removing the product from your catalog forever."

After which, you can use Get Product API (v202309) to retrieve a product's existing property values (including its listing quality tier) and pinpoint the ones that need to be edited.\n\nDiagnosis results and recommendations\n\nThe diagnosis is performed on the following product fields:\n- Title: The product title (API property: title)\n- Description: The product description (API property: description)\n- Attributes: The product attributes (API property: product_attributes or skus.sales_attributes)\n- Size chart: The size chart image (API property: size_chart)\n- Product images: The product images displayed in the image gallery (API property: main_images)\n\nRefer to the following region-based tables for the diagnosis results/codes returned in the APIs and the actionable recommendations to optimize your listings effectively.\nNote: Codes marked as \"Retired\" indicate that they are no longer recommended and will not appear anymore.\n\nUnited States\n\nIn the US, product listings are evaluated based on a tiered system that includes listing quality tiers such as \"POOR\", FAIR\", and \"GOOD\". Each diagnosis code corresponds to a specific recommendation and is assigned a quality tier, such as \"FAIR\" or \"GOOD\".

If the audit passes, v2 is published to the shop, otherwise, the existing product stays live and remains unchanged (keeping v1). However, edits to the price or inventory fields do not require a reaudit and will be immediately published on the platform. Use the Product status change webhook to keep track of the review status.​ Note: ​ - This API is applicable only for local sellers and intra-EU sellers.​ - There may be a limit to the number of products you can relist per day. We recommend prioritizing key products first to ensure they get published. You can find your listing limit on the Seller Center homepage.​ - Updates are handled per top-level property, so all non-empty fields within an updated object must be supplied to prevent overwriting with blanks. For top-level properties (e.g. description, brand_id) that are not nested in an object, you can update them individually. Omitting these properties in the request will leave them unchanged. If you need to edit any nested property within an object, you must provide values for all nested properties of that object. Any omitted nested properties will be overwritten with blanks. For example, if you want to update identifier_code.code, you must also include the identifier_code.type property to avoid data loss for that property.​ - If new mandatory product attributes were added by TikTok Shop after the creation of your product, ensure that you provide these attributes too.​ For Tokopedia sellers:​ Note that a product can have only one active version across all platforms at any time. If a product is live on both platforms, audit results for the latest version are handled as follows:​ - Mixed audit results: If the product passes audit on one platform but fails on another, on the successful platform, the product will stay live and be updated with content from the latest version (v2), while on the failed platform, the product will be deactivated and hidden entirely.​ - Audit failure on all platforms: If the product fails audit on all platforms, the existing product stays live and remains unchanged (keeping v1).​ Version\n202309\n  \nAPI Testing Tool\n​",

If the audit passes, v2 is published to the shop, otherwise, the existing product stays live and remains unchanged (keeping v1). However, edits to the price or inventory fields do not require a reaudit and will be immediately published on the platform. Use the Product status change webhook to keep track of the review status.​ Note: ​ - This API is applicable only for active sellers/shops that have completed the KYC onboarding process.​ - There may be a limit to the number of products you can relist per day. We recommend prioritizing key products first to ensure they get published. You can find your listing limit on the Seller Center homepage.​ - All inputs, including blanks, in the request payload will overwrite existing values. To retain an existing value, make sure to include it in your request. Exceptions to this rule are the price and inventory fields, which will remain unchanged if they are omitted from the request. If you wish to edit only certain properties, you can use the Partial Edit Product API, Update Inventory API, or the Update Price API.​ - The language used in the product content must align with the target market's language (e.g. don't use Chinese), otherwise the listing will fail or be rejected.​ For Tokopedia sellers:​ Note that a product can have only one active version across all platforms at any time. If a product is live on both platforms, audit results for the latest version are handled as follows:​ - Mixed audit results: If the product passes audit on one platform but fails on another, on the successful platform, the product will stay live and be updated with content from the latest version (v2), while on the failed platform, the product will be deactivated and hidden entirely.​ - Audit failure on all platforms: If the product fails audit on all platforms, the existing product stays live and remains unchanged (keeping v1).​ Version\n202309\n  \nAPI Testing Tool\n​",

For other categories, contact your account manager for assistance. After product creation, use the Publish Global Product API to publish and translate the product in the desired markets.​ Key concept: Global products are products created by cross-border sellers to be sold in shops outside of their base country. With global products, cross-border sellers operating across multiple markets can avoid creating the same product for each shop individually. Instead, they just need to create a single global product, which can be published and synced to all their shops, simplifying product management across markets.​ Note:​ - This API is applicable only for intra-EU sellers and global sellers. To create and list local products intended for sale exclusively in local shops, use the Create Product API instead.​ - There may be a limit to the number of products you can list per day. We recommend prioritizing the creation of key products first to ensure they get published. You can find your listing limit on the Seller Center homepage.​ - The language used in the product content must align with the target market's language (e.g. don't use Chinese), otherwise the listing will fail or be rejected.​ Version\n202309\n  \nAPI Testing Tool\n​",

The prices after discount are shown with the original prices crossed out. Here's an example:\n\nYou can apply the activity on product detail pages, livestreams, and showcases. The visual effects are almost the same in these scenarios.\nThere are two discount types:\n\nFixed Price: Specify the final price after discount.\n\nPercentage Off: Specify the portion of the deduction amount to the original price.\n\nFlash Deal\n\nYou can use the Flash Deal activity to create discounts for your specific products. The products in a flash deal will be highlighted with a limited-time countdown. Here's an example:\n\nThe deal price for each product needs to be equal to or lower than the price paid by customers in the last 30 days.\n\nCoupon / Seller Voucher\n\nYou can use coupon activities in the US, or seller voucher activities in other districts, in combination with other promotional activities. You can set this up in the Seller Center, and the visual effect of the coupon depends on your setting.\nYou cannot set this up using OpenAPI, but you can search for and get the details of the existing coupon activities.\n\nAPI List\n\nYou can create and manage your promotion activities in Seller Center and Seller App; you can also do that with Promotion APIs. Here's the list of Promotion APIs:\n\nTo manage product discount or flash deal activities, refer to:\nCreate Activity;\nSearch Activities;\nGet Activities;\nUpdate Activity;\nDeactivate Activities.\nTo update the products included in a product discount or a flash deal activity, refer to:\nUpdate Activity Product;\nRemove Activity Product.\nTo search and get the details of a coupon activity, refer to:\nSearch Coupons;\nGet Coupons."

    "title": "Order API overview",
    "content": "Context\n\nThe Orders API helps you obtain information about orders.\nYou may programmatically GET an Order List, and GET the Order Details from a specific Order.\nAdditionally, you may also subscribe to the Order Status Webhook to be notified regarding order status changes.\n\nImportant Concepts\nOrder\n\nAn order is created when the buyer clicks on the Place Order button. Please note that when the order is created, the buyer has yet to make the payment, therefore the status of the order is UNPAID. Once an order is created, the seller should deduct or hold inventory from their inventory management system accordingly.\n\nOrder Structure\n\nOrder ID: An Order ID is a unique identifier for each Order that is created by a Buyer.\n\nSKU ID: An order line contains 1 or more items of products of the same Stock Keeping Unit. Each SKU is identified by its unique SKU ID. A SKU can be thought of as a \"variant\".\n\nOrder Line Item id: Each single item in a line is identified by its unique order line item id.\n\n\n\n\nExample- A buyer places an order for 5 products total: 2 Red Large T-shirts, 2 Red Medium T-shirts, and 1 size 10 black shoes:\n\nOrder\tSKU\tLine item\n\nOrder ID: 12345678\n\n\t\nRed Large T Shirt\n\t\n1x Red Large T Shirt (item 1)\n\n\n\t\n\t\n1x Red Large T Shirt (item 2)\n\n\n\t\nRed Medium t shirt\n\n\t\n1x Red Medium t shirt (item 3)\n\n\n\t\n\t\n1x Red Medium t shirt (item 4)\n\n\n\t\nSize 10 Black Shoes\n\t\n1 size 10 black shoes (item 5)\nOrder Status\nOrder Status Definition\nStatus\tDescription\n\nUNPAID\n\t\nThe order has been placed but payment has been authorized.\n\n\nON_HOLD\n\t\nAfter payment is completed for the order, the order transitions into the ON_HOLD status during the remorse period. The remorse period allows the buyer to cancel the order without seller approval. ON_HOLD orders are not allowed to be fulfilled.\n\n\nAWAITING_SHIPMENT\n\t\nAwaiting the seller to place a logistic order.\n\n\nPARTIALLY_SHIPPING\n\t\nOne or more (but not all) items in the order have been shipped.\n\n\nAWAITING_COLLECTION\n\t\nThe logistics order was placed. At least one item in the order is still waiting to be collected by the carrier.\n\n\nIN_TRANSIT\n\t\nAll items have been collected by the carrier. At least one package is has yet to be delivered to the buyer.\n\n\nDELIVERED\n\t\nAll items have been delivered to the buyer.\n\n\nCOMPLETED\n\t\nThe order has been completed. Completed orders can no longer be returned or refunded.\n\n\nCANCELLED\n\n\t\nThe order has been canceled. The order can be canceled by the buyer, the seller, the TikTok SYSTEM, or a TikTok OPERATOR.\n\n* Buyer: Buyers can change their mind and cancel within 1 hour post purchase, known as 1-hour remorse. Past this period, Buyer can still request a cancellation, but it is subject to Seller approval.\n* Seller: Sellers can cancel an order, for example if they are out of stock of the product.\n* SYSTEM: Orders may be cancelled by the TikTok system automatically based on TikTok policies. For example, this can happen if a package is lost in transit, and TikTok detects that the tracking ID has not progressed for over 7 days.\n* OPERATOR: Orders may also be cancelled by TikTok customer service for a variety of reasons.\n\nFor a comprehensive list of supported cancellation reasons, please visit this page.\nOrder Status Transitions\nFrom UNPAID to ON_HOLD\nTrigger: When the order is paid, the order status updates to ON_HOLD.\nTrigger initiator: Buyer\nNote:\nFor ON_HOLD orders, the recipient address and buyer information are not available via the Order API.\nCurrently, the ON_HOLD status is only available in the US & UK market.\nFrom ON_HOLD to AWAITING_SHIPMENT\nTrigger: After the remorse window(1 hour after payment), the order status changes to AWAITING_SHIPMENT.\nTrigger initiator: TiKTok\nNote: This step occurs automatically.\nFrom AWAITING_SHIPMENT to PARTIALLY_SHIPPING\nTrigger: When some item(s) in the order but not all have been shipped.\nTrigger initiator: Seller\nNote: only split shipments have this status.

Only all the items have been arranged shipment, then the order status will be updated to AWAITING_COLLECTION.\nTrigger initiator: Seller\nNote: Once the seller arranges shipment, the buyer can not cancel request without seller approval.\nFrom AWAITING_COLLECTION to IN_TRANSIT\nScenario A(Seller ships all items in one package)\nTrigger: Once TikTok obtains the shipment tracking information of packages from the carrier system, the order status will be updated to IN_TRANSIT from AWAITING_COLLECTION.\nTrigger initiator: TikTok\nScenario B(Seller split order to ship)\nTrigger: Once Tiktok obtains the shipment tracking information of all packages from the carrier system, the order status will be updated to IN_TRANSIT from AWAITING_COLLECTION.\nNote: TikTok obtains shipment tracking information from various tracking data providers. Depending on the performance of the provider, the tracking information may be delayed. If the shipment tracking information delay is over 24 hours, please contact TikTok.\nFrom IN_TRANSIT to DELIVERED\nTrigger: The package has been successfully delivered.\nTrigger initiator: TikTok\nFrom DELIVERED to COMPLETED.\nScenario A(Buyer requests refund or return)\nTrigger: Buyers can initiate a multi-time return or refund request.

The order status will only updated to 'CANCELLED' when all items in the order have been cancelled.\n\nFulfillment Types and Delivery Options\n\nFulfillment Types\n\nTikTok Shop offers two fulfillment types:\n\nFULFILLMENT_BY_SELLER: The seller fulfills orders directly from their own warehouses. In this model, the seller is responsible for storing, packaging, and shipping the products to customers.\nFULFILLMENT_BY_TIKTOK: The seller stocks their products in Tiktok's fulfillment centers. Tiktok is responsible for storing, picking, packing, and shipping the products to customers.\nShipping type\n\nFor FULFILLMENT_BY_SELLER, there are two shipping types:\n\nTikTok Shipping: Tiktok provides shipping services. The seller obtains shipping labels from Tiktok.\n\nSeller Shipping: The seller arranges shipping.\n\nRecipient Address\nRecipient Information Redaction\n\nIn the following scenarios, the recipient's address and personal information will be redacted.\n\nOrder fulfillment_type = FULFILLMENT_BY_TIKTOK\nOrder fulfillment_type = FULFILLMENT_BY_SELLER and shipping type = TikTok\nLocalized Recipient Address\n\nDifferent countries may have different address hierarchy and naming conventions. To accommodate such differences, use 'district_info_list' to obtain address information expressed in the local address hierarchy and naming convention.\n\nOrder SLA (Service Level Agreement) Information\n\nCurrently, Tiktok shop has the following Service Level Agreement concept.\nrts_sla: \"RTS\" is the abbreviation for Ready To Ship. RTS marks the time when the order status transitions to AWAITING_COLLECTION. rts_sla indicates the time period within which TikTok requires the seller to ship the order. If the order status has not transitioned to AWAITING_COLLECTION before rts_sla has passed, this constitutes a late dispatch, which will increase the seller's late dispatch rate.\ntts_sla: \"TTS\" stands for Transfer To Ship. TTS marks the time when the order status transitions to IN_TRANSIT. tts_sla specifies the time period within which TikTok requires the packages to be collected by the carrier. If the order status has not transitioned to IN_TRANSIT before tts_sla has passed, this constitutes a late dispatch, which will increase the seller's late dispatch rate.\ndelivery_sla: The time period within which TikTok requires the packages to be delivered to the buyer.\ncancel_order_sla: If the seller fails to complete the shipment by this time point, the order will be automatically canceled by the platform. TikTok might cancel the order, if the order doesn't arrange the shipment before rts_sla or the order can not obtain the tracking information before tts_sla. Policy details, please see the Seller Academy.\n\nTikTok Shop Marketplace Policies\n\nAs a Marketplace, TikTok Shop imposes certain policies on sellers for the benefit of both buyers and sellers.\n\nCancel Policy\n\nBuyer cancel order within 1-hour:\n\nBuyers are able to cancel their order within one hour for no charge: this is known as the 1-hour remorse period. This is required for all shops. We simply recommend that sellers wait one hour before beginning fulfillment of the Order, and for all apps and services to implement this 1-hour remorse period. In the US & UK market, this 1-hour remorse window is ON_HOLD status.\n\nBuyer request cancel after 1-hour:\n\nAfter 1-hour, buyer cancel request required to review by seller. The seller can accept or decline the cancel request.\n\nOrder Fulfillment SLA(Service Level Agreement) Policy\nThe seller should arrange shipment before rts_sla time.\nThe shipping service provider must update the tracking information of package collection before the tts_sla time.\nIf the Seller is not able to fulfill an Order with a valid shipping ID before cancel_order_sla, the Order will be cancelled and the Buyer refunded.\nFrequently Asked Questions\nHow do I get order ID from?\nTo utilize the Orders API, you must subscribe to the Orders Webhook. Click here for more details\nMy item is partially out of stock. Can I ship only part of the Order?\nCurrently, we don't provide this functionality.

    "category": "Fulfillment",
    "title": "Fulfillment API overview",
    "content": "Context\n\nThe Fulfillment API allows sellers to fulfill TikTok Shop orders.\n\nTikTok Shop offers two types of fulfillment types:\n\nFulfilled by TikTok (FULFILLMENT_BY_TIKTOK): TikTok will automatically process the order on behalf of the seller. The seller does not need to manage the fulfillment process.\nFulfilled by Seller (FULFILLMENT_BY_SELLER): Under this Fulfillment Type, there are two shipping types:\n\na) TikTok shipping (TIKTOK): Sometimes also referred to as \"platform shipping\" or \"shipped via platform.\" With this shipping type, the seller purchases shipping labels through TikTok Shop, and schedules a pick-up from a TikTok Shop carrier, or drops off parcels at the TikTok Shop carriers' drop-off locations. The seller can obtain the shipping type from Get Order Detail or Get Order List.\n\nb) Seller shipping (SELLER): Sometimes also referred to as \"shipped via seller.\" The seller manages shipping through their own channel(s). With this shipping type, the sellers call the Fulfillment API to provide shipping details back to TikTok Shop. The seller can obtain shipping type from Get Order Detail or Get Order List.\n\nThe Fulfillment API also offers both split-package and consolidated-package (sometimes also referred to as combined package) shipment options to support more flexible shipping needs. The seller can obtain fulfillment type from Get Order Detail or Get Order List.\n\nAvailable markets\n\nCurrently, fulfillment API flows are supported in the following markets (denoted ISO 3166, two-letter abbreviations will be used for the rest of the document):\n\nNorth America\nUnited States (US)\nEast Asia\nJapan (JP)\nSoutheast Asia (SEA)\nIndonesia (ID)\nThailand (TH)\nSingapore (SG)\nMalaysia (MY)\nVietnam (VN)\nPhillipines (PH)\nEurope (EMEA)\nUnited Kingdom (UK)\nSpain (ES)\nIreland (IE)\nGermany (DE)\nFrance (FR)\nItaly (IT)\nLatin America (LATAM)\nBrazil (BR)\nMexico (MX)\nImportant concepts\nPackage\nUS market\n\nIn the US market, a package is generated after the seller completes the shipment by calling one of the ship order APIs (Mark Package As Shipped/Create Packages/Schedule Package Handover) successfully. The items included in the package are specified by the seller when calling said APIs. The package_id will be returned in the response parameters in Mark Package As Shipped/Create Packages APIs.\n\nNon-US market (SEA, EMEA, LATAM)\n\nIn the SEA, EMEA, and LATAM markets, a package is generated after the buyer pays the order. The package includes all item(s) within the order. The package_id will be returned in the response parameters in Get Order Detail.\n\nFulfillment\nFulfillment types\n\nFULFILLMENT_BY_TIKTOK: The seller does not need to call any Fulfillment APIs to arrange fulfillment.

For instance, if the buyer purchases two pairs of jeans and one shirt, both pairs of jeans must be shipped in the same package, while the shirt can be split into a separate package.\n\nIn-shipping split (US, EMEA and JP):\nNo restriction. All items in the order can be split into different packages arbitrarily.\n\nConsolidate order fulfillment policy\n\nIn-shipping consolidation (US, EMEA, and JP)\n\nAll orders using the same tracking number for shipment must have the same recipient's name and shipping address.\nA single tracking number can be used to ship a maximum of 20 orders for consolidated shipment.\nUpdate order tracking number policy\n\nUS, UK, and SEA:\nSellers must update any changes to a package’s tracking number or shipping carrier within 72 hours of shipment.

If the tracking number is not verified by the chosen shipping provider, an error will be returned.\n\nFrequently asked questions\nCan I use shipping service providers outside of the platform's list?\n\nNo. It will make TikTok unable to obtain shipment tracking information. If TikTok cannot obtain the shipment tracking information within the time specified in cancel_sla_time, the order may be canceled by TikTok.\n\nDo I need to handle shipping operations for orders with 'FULFILL_BY_TIKTOK'?\n\nNo. TikTok will fulfill the order.\n\nCan I obtain shipping labels from TikTok at any time?\n\nNo. A shipping label is only available after shipping has been arranged for a package, and before the package is handed over to the carrier.\n\nIf I have already handed over the package to the shipping service provider, but the order status on the platform has not progressed to 'IN_TRANSIT', what should I do?\n\nFirst, you need to confirm that the shipping service provider you are using is supported by the platform. If it is confirmed to be supported, please get in touch with the shipping service provider to ensure that the package has been scanned into their system. If you have already tracked the tracking information on the official logistics website but the platform still does not show any tracking details, please contact TikTok for assistance."

    "content": "Context\n\nThe Logistic API helps you obtain information about logistic resources including:\n\nGet Warehouse List\n\nGet Subscribed Delivery Options\n\nGet Shipping Providers\n\nGet Global Warehouse List\n\nWhen sellers create/publish products, they may need to:\n\nGet Warehouse List\nGet Global Warehouse List\n\nFor more detail, please refer to the \"Product API\" overview.\n\nWhen sellers fulfill orders, they may need to:\n\nGet Subscribed Delivery Options\nGet Shipping Providers\n\nFor more detail, please refer to the \"Fulfillment API\" overview.\n\nImportant Concepts\nWarehouse\n\nWarehouses are setup by sellers when they create their TikTok Shop account. This is where packages will be sent out from once an order needs to be shipped.\nOne seller can have multiple global warehouses.\nOne seller can have multiple warehouses for one shop.\n\nWhen sellers want to create a global product, they need to clarify inventory based on global warehouses(Get Global Warehouse List API).\nWhen sellers want to publish a global product, they need to clarify inventory based on warehouses.(Get Warehouse List API)\n\nDelivery Option\n\nA delivery option is a logistic solution which assists sellers to handover goods to customers.\nA delivery option includes a set of shipping providers and shipping services.\nSeller needs to fulfill order under delivery option requirement, including shipping providers, shipping services, dimension, weight, etc.\nA delivery option is chosen by the buyer, when the buyer places an order on TikTok. Examples of delivery options include \"Express shipping\" for Seller Shipping, \"Economy Shipping\" for TikTok Shipping, etc.\nPlease note that Express Shipping for Seller Shipping, and Express Shipping for TikTok Shipping are in fact two different delivery options.\n\nShipping Type\n\nShipping type is how sellers can ship packages. It's a property of delivery option.\nTikTok supports multiple shipping types:\n\nPlatform - Sellers connect with shipping providers through TikTok.\nSeller - Sellers connect with shipping providers their own channels, then upload tracking numbers to TikTok for further tracking.\n\nFor different regions, TikTok provides different services for shipping , including purchasing labels, arranging shipments, etc.\n\nShipping Service( for US )\n\nA shipping service is a specific logistic service which is provided by one provider.\nDifferent delivery options have different available shipping services.\nExamples of shipping services include \"USPS Ground\", \"DHL eCommerce SM parcel\".\n\nShipping provider\n\nShipping providers are providers who provide shipping services.\nDifferent delivery options have different available shipping providers.\nFor orders which use \"seller shipping\" type delivery option, seller needs to update shipping provider and tracking number during fulfillment.\nExamples of shipping providers include \"USPS\", \"DHL eCommerce\".\nImportant tips: \"DHL\" and \"DHL eCommerce\" are two providers.\n\nThe diagram below outlines the relationship between delivery option, shipping provider and shipping service.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\nWhat is the relationship between a seller and a shop?\n\nOne seller can run businesses in multiple regions.\nFor each region, one seller can have one TikTok shop.\n\n\nWhat is the relationship between a global warehouse and a warehouse?\n\nWhen there is a global warehouse, for every region, there is a warehouse which actually refers to the global warehouse.\n\nWhat is the relationship between a warehouse and a deliveryOption?\n\nOne warehouse can subscribe multiple delivery options.\n\n\nWhat is the difference between different delivery options?\n\nThere are several pieces of fulfillment info in an order's Order Detail:\n\nDelivery option id\nFulfillment type: means goods will be shipped from TikTok warehouse or seller warehouse\n* FULFILLMENT_BY_TIKTOK\n* FULFILLMENT_BY_SELLER\nShip type: means package will purchase label through TikTok or through seller's own channel.\n* TikTok\n* Seller\n\nFor fulfillment type - FULFILLMENT_BY_TIKTOK, TikTok will automatically process the order on behalf of the seller. The seller does not need to manage the fulfillment process.\nFor fulfillment type - FULFILLMENT_BY_SELLER, sellers need to use Fulfillment API to process order.\nFor more detail of fulfillment flows, please refer to Fulfillment API overview."

    "content": "Customer engagement is crucial for businesses looking to build lasting relationships with their customers and drive conversions. Therefore, we offer a suite of Customer Engagement API endpoints that enable businesses to integrate their CRM platforms with TikTok Shop to capitalize on TikTok's extensive reach.\n\nBenefits of integrating with TikTok Shop:\n- Increased customer engagement by reaching a vast, active user base on TikTok and engage potential customers in a platform-native way.\n- Interactive product promotion through TikTok's dynamic content formats, including products, coupons, and live streams.\n- Enhanced product discovery through relevant, targeted content directly on TikTok Shop.\n- Data-driven optimization by leveraging performance metrics to enhance marketing effectiveness and maximize ROI.\n\nKey features\n\nEngage customers with targeted messaging\nCreate custom messages or leverage predefined message templates to send targeted messages to past buyers based on their purchase activity, such as promoting new products, or offering discounts. This helps keep customers engaged with your brand throughout their shopping journey.\n\nManage and optimize engagement tasks\nCreate and track engagement tasks to organize your marketing efforts. Retrieve detailed performance metrics, such as message reads and order conversions, to refine engagement strategies and drive higher customer interaction and conversions.\n\nKey usage flow\n\nAccess to the Customer Engagement API is subject to eligibility requirements. Some features, such as creating custom messages, also require specific permissions. Use Get Feature Permissions to check your access permissions first.\n\nImportant Concepts\nEngagement Task\n\nAn engagement task acts as a container for grouping messages with similar content and rules, allowing sellers to track and compare task performance across different types of content. This helps sellers refine their messaging strategies over time. To link tasks with messages, you must assign the relevant task ID when sending the messages.\nA task can be used for both one-time and ongoing automated messaging, and multiple recipients can be targeted within a single API call by assigning the relevant buyer's email when sending the messages. Note that each task has a mandatory end time, and once expired, it cannot be used to send additional messages.\n\nTikTok Instant Messaging (IM)\n\nEngagement messages are sent to buyers through TikTok Instant Messaging, which is located in the TikTok App > Inbox > TikTok Shop > [Shop Name].\n\nMessage Template\n\nTikTok Shop offers a library of predefined message templates which you can use directly in your customer engagement communications. These templates are categorized into various scenarios, allowing sellers to select from them based on their preferences. Each template supports adding up to 4 product cards and 1 coupon card, enabling sellers to create engaging and impactful messages tailored to their audience.\nYou can also create custom messages if none of the templates fit your needs.\n\nProduct card\n\nAn interactive card sent in TikTok Shop instant messages to promote a product, displaying its details, such as title, image, description, and price, enabling customers to easily explore and purchase items directly from the message. Refer to Get Product or Search Products to obtain the ID of the product that you'd like to promote.\n\nCoupon card\n\nAn interactive card sent in TikTok Shop instant messages that provides discounts or promotional codes, enabling customers to redeem special offers and save on purchases directly from the message with a simple tap. Refer to Get Coupon or Search Coupons for the types of coupons available and to obtain the corresponding coupon ID.\n\nRequirements and limitations\nSupported markets\nUnited States local sellers\nLimitations\nLimitations\tDescription\n\nMessage senders\n\n\t\nOnly eligible sellers are permitted to use Customer Engagement APIs and features. Use Get Feature Permissions to check your access permissions.\nFor more information about how to obtain access, refer to TikTok Shop Academy - Customer Engagement Tools\n\n\nMessage recipients\n\n\t\nYou can send messages to buyers who have placed at least one order in the shop within the past 365 days.\nNote: It may take up to 48 hours for a buyer to be added to the eligible buyer list after a purchase. For example, if a buyer places an order on day T, they will become eligible to receive messages starting from day T+2.\n\n\nEngagement task limit\n\n\t\nA maximum of 100 active tasks can be running simultaneously. Tasks will automatically expire after 180 days, releasing the quota for new tasks.\n\n\nMessage sending limit\n\t\n1 message per calendar week, shared across all channels (API and Customer Engagement Tool).\n\n\nPerformance data retrieval time\n\t\nThe performance data for each task is available 48 hours after execution.\nFrequently asked questions\nQ: Can the message templates be customized?\nA: Selected sellers can use the Create Custom Engagement Task to create custom messages.

    "content": "📌 Note: Affiliate APIs are currently not available in the UK and EU markets.\n\nContext\n\nDevelopment partners can integrate with the TikTok Shop Affiliate APIs to help TikTok Shop stakeholders create, manage, matchmake, track, monetize, and collaborate across TikTok Shop Affiliate Collaborations and Partner Campaigns. Listing an Affiliate API integrated app within the TikTok Shop App Store offers development partners numerous advantages:\n\nSupport for Existing Customers: Satisfy and support your existing customers who are already on TikTok Shop or will be joining soon.\n\nIncreased Exposure: Gain visibility among TikTok Shop sellers looking for affiliate solutions within the app store.\n\nMarketing Opportunities: Benefit from inclusion in marketing initiatives related to the TikTok Shop App Store.\n\nCompetitive Differentiation: Stand out from competitors that are not integrated with TikTok Shop.\n\nEnhanced Revenue Generation: Provide a down-funnel, measurable solution that focuses on performance and revenue generation, beyond just top-of-funnel awareness and engagement marketing.\n\nTypes of Affiliate APIs\n\nThere are 3 types of APIs available for affiliate management:\n\nAffiliate Seller API: Help sellers maximize product visibility through open and target collaborations with TikTok Shop Creator Affiliates, facilitate seamless product promotion, and track the overall conversions from their affiliate marketing efforts.\n\nAffiliate Creator API: Help TikTok Shop Creator Affiliates manage their collaborations and product showcases on TikTok Shop, while also tracking the conversion from their marketing efforts.\n\nAffiliate Partner API: Help TikTok Affiliate Partners (TAPs) effectively manage campaigns that match-make sellers with TikTok Shop Creator Affiliates, optimizing product promotion for sellers while offering enhanced monetization opportunities for TikTok Shop Creator Affiliates.\n\nDevelopment partners can use a combination of these APIs to:\n\nEnroll seller's catalog into open collaboration\n\nCreate open collaboration\n\nCreate target collaboration\n\nCreate partner campaign\n\nHelp sellers find creators\n\nand more...\n\nImportant Concepts\nTikTok Shop Affiliate Program\n\nThe TikTok Shop Affiliate Program consists of Affiliate Collaborations and Affiliate Partner Campaigns, both of which allow sellers and TikTok Shop Creator Affiliates to collaborate and build the next era of social commerce based on engaging shoppable content on TikTok.\n\nTikTok Shop Creator Affiliates are creators that are eligible to sell e-commerce products on TikTok Shop. To be eligible, creators need to fulfil these requirements:\nRegistered in the US, UK, and SEA\nUS: 1K+ followers\nUK, SEA: 5K+ followers\n18+ years old\nNo more than 3 violations on their account\n\nCreators can apply to be included in the affiliate program here.\n(Henceforth, TikTok Shop Creator Affiliates will be generally referred to as creators.)\n\n📌 Note: Currently there is no way for external partners to facilitate or moderate creator onboarding programmatically. We will improve upon this in a future iteration, but for now, you can check whether a creator is a TikTok Shop Creator Affiliate in 2 ways:\n\nThe Creator has a \"Showcase\" icon on their profile\nThe Creator is able to successfully authorize the partner\n\nNote that TikTok Shop Creator Authorization is currently separate from TikTok for Business or TikTok for Developers.\n\n\n\nShoppable content in the context of TikTok Shop refers to engaging TikTok videos created by creators, where they tag seller products within the videos and embed native anchor links that allow the end-user to directly shop on the creator's content. Key characteristics of e-commerce based on shoppable content:\n\nUnlike traditional e-commerce affiliates (links, coupon codes, social media redirects), this type of content eliminates issues with attribution and cookie durations since users engage and purchase without navigating away from the app.\n\nIt enables straightforward and performance-based monetization, eliminating ambiguities often found in traditional marketing approaches. Creators earn a commission (determined by the seller) on the purchases they directly drive (no view attribution), while sellers receive the remaining payout from the sales after taxes and fees.\n\n💡What this means for stakeholders?\n\nBuyers (TikTok App users) gain exposure to products through trusted creators and enjoy a direct path to purchasing.\nSellers benefit from engaging TikTok-style shoppable content via creators and a pay-for-performance model without significant upfront costs.\nCreators benefit from high potential for performance-based compensation and diverse collaboration opportunities with sellers to promote products.\n\nAffiliate Collaborations\n\nOne of the most basic ways to monetize through affiliates is through direct affiliate collaborations between sellers and creators. There are 2 kinds of collaboration modes in the TikTok Shop Affiliate program:\n\nOpen Collaboration\nAn Open Collaboration refers to a collaboration model where a seller enrolls products into an Open Plan, making the products available for all TikTok Shop Creator Affilitates to see on the Creator Marketplace.\nYou can think of an Open Collaboration as a club which is open to creators, the only requirement being that the creator has registered and is approved to be a TikTok Shop Creator Affiliate.\nIn some cases, sellers can require approval on an Open Collaboration. This means the Open Collaboration is visible to creators but they must apply and pass seller approval to participate. You can think of this as a club bouncer giving partygoers a quick vibe check.\n\nTarget Collaboration\nA Target Collaboration refers to a collaboration model where a seller enrolls products into a Target Plan, making the products available only to TikTok Shop Creator Affilitates that are explicitly invited by the seller.\nYou can think of a Target Collaboration as a club which is invite only. Creators can only get into the club if they are invited by the seller. Once inside, creators must abide by the club's rules and can be removed at anytime.\nTarget Collaborations are a great way for sellers to find creators that suit the seller's unique voice on TikTok, and typically involve creators who have proven themselves through historical performance or possess a strong content portfolio, often carrying higher commission rates.\n\n💡What this means for stakeholders? Development Partners can leverage from these collaborations by potentially charging a SaaS fee to sellers or creators, or by taking a cut of the matchmaking efforts outside of the TikTok Shop platform directly with the seller or creator.\n\nAffiliate Partner Campaigns\n\nAffiliate Partner Campaigns refers to a collaboration model where TikTok Affiliate Partners (TAPs) help sellers and creators matchmake more efficiently. This model is very similar to sub-affiliates in the traditional affiliate marketing space, with TAPs acting as sub-affiliates, referring the best-fit creators to sellers.\nContinuing off the analogy above regarding clubs, you can think of a TAP as a club promoter - someone who knows which club is best for whom. Club promoters have a pulse on the local club scene, including the age group, DJs, music genres, trends, and overall vibes.\nIn the context of TikTok Shop, TAP can recommend viral TikTok trends, products, and help both sellers and creators succeed at creating content for the social commerce era. Some examples of TAP initiatives include creator monetization apps, creator or influencer marketing platforms, sub-affiliates etc.\n\nThe nature of Affiliate Partner Campaigns differs slightly based on the region.\n\nUS/EMEA: One(TAP)-to-one(seller) campaigns are the norm. This is no different from an Open or Target Collaboration, except that the TAP facilitates the matchmaking process, thereby taking a cut off the commission. You can think of a TAP as a sub-affiliate network.\n\nRest of world: One-to-many campaigns are the norm. TAPs often design campaigns that allow for collaboration with multiple TikTok Shop sellers and creators under one broader campaign initiative. These campaigns are geared towards TAPs supporting multiple brands at once, and provide flexibility in commission structures:\n\nEnables third party commission sharing (payout to both TAP and creators upon sales)\nDifferent customization levers around commissions\n\nDespite the differences, commission sharing is a universal feature across all Affiliate Partner Campaigns. It is key to how TAPs monetize their efforts.\n\n💡What this means for stakeholders? TikTok Affiliate Partners (TAPs) that are API-enabled can now efficiently manage Affiliate Partner Campaigns through automation by using these APIs. Essentially, Affiliate Partner Campaigns function similarly to Open or Target Collaborations, except that TAPs can directly monetize off the transaction. If you are a partner that prefers to monetize off SaaS fees or other means, we recommend that you leverage from the Open or Target Collaboration model.\n\nTikTok Shop Partner Center Policies\n\nhttps://partner.tiktokshop.com/docv2/page/6506bbf2de672602b7bc0697"

    "content": "📌 Note: Affiliate APIs are currently not available in the UK and EU markets.\n\nContext\n\nDevelopment partners can integrate with the TikTok Shop Affiliate APIs to help TikTok Shop stakeholders create, manage, matchmake, track, monetize, and collaborate across TikTok Shop Affiliate Collaborations and Partner Campaigns. Listing an Affiliate API integrated app within the TikTok Shop App Store offers development partners numerous advantages:\n\nSupport for Existing Customers: Satisfy and support your existing customers who are already on TikTok Shop or will be joining soon.\n\nIncreased Exposure: Gain visibility among TikTok Shop sellers looking for affiliate solutions within the app store.\n\nMarketing Opportunities: Benefit from inclusion in marketing initiatives related to the TikTok Shop App Store.\n\nCompetitive Differentiation: Stand out from competitors that are not integrated with TikTok Shop.\n\nEnhanced Revenue Generation: Provide a down-funnel, measurable solution that focuses on performance and revenue generation, beyond just top-of-funnel awareness and engagement marketing.\n\nTypes of Affiliate APIs\n\nThere are 3 types of APIs available for affiliate management:\n\nAffiliate Seller API: Help sellers maximize product visibility through open and target collaborations with TikTok Shop Creator Affiliates, facilitate seamless product promotion, and track the overall conversions from their affiliate marketing efforts.\n\nAffiliate Creator API: Help TikTok Shop Creator Affiliates manage their collaborations and product showcases on TikTok Shop, while also tracking the conversion from their marketing efforts.\n\nAffiliate Partner API: Help TikTok Affiliate Partners (TAPs) effectively manage campaigns that match-make sellers with TikTok Shop Creator Affiliates, optimizing product promotion for sellers while offering enhanced monetization opportunities for TikTok Shop Creator Affiliates.\n\nDevelopment partners can use a combination of these APIs to:\n\nEnroll seller's catalog into open collaboration\n\nCreate open collaboration\n\nCreate target collaboration\n\nCreate partner campaign\n\nHelp sellers find creators\n\nand more...\n\nImportant Concepts\nTikTok Shop Affiliate Program\n\nThe TikTok Shop Affiliate Program consists of Affiliate Collaborations and Affiliate Partner Campaigns, both of which allow sellers and TikTok Shop Creator Affiliates to collaborate and build the next era of social commerce based on engaging shoppable content on TikTok.\n\nTikTok Shop Creator Affiliates are creators that are eligible to sell e-commerce products on TikTok Shop. To be eligible, creators need to fulfil these requirements:\nRegistered in the US, UK, and SEA\nUS: 1K+ followers\nUK, SEA: 5K+ followers\n18+ years old\nNo more than 3 violations on their account\n\nCreators can apply to be included in the affiliate program here.\n(Henceforth, TikTok Shop Creator Affiliates will be generally referred to as creators.)\n\n📌 Note: Currently there is no way for external partners to facilitate or moderate creator onboarding programmatically. We will improve upon this in a future iteration, but for now, you can check whether a creator is a TikTok Shop Creator Affiliate in 2 ways:\n\nThe Creator has a \"Showcase\" icon on their profile\nThe Creator is able to successfully authorize the partner\n\nNote that TikTok Shop Creator Authorization is currently separate from TikTok for Business or TikTok for Developers.\n\n\n\nShoppable content in the context of TikTok Shop refers to engaging TikTok videos created by creators, where they tag seller products within the videos and embed native anchor links that allow the end-user to directly shop on the creator's content. Key characteristics of e-commerce based on shoppable content:\n\nUnlike traditional e-commerce affiliates (links, coupon codes, social media redirects), this type of content eliminates issues with attribution and cookie durations since users engage and purchase without navigating away from the app.\n\nIt enables straightforward and performance-based monetization, eliminating ambiguities often found in traditional marketing approaches. Creators earn a commission (determined by the seller) on the purchases they directly drive (no view attribution), while sellers receive the remaining payout from the sales after taxes and fees.\n\n💡What this means for stakeholders?\n\nBuyers (TikTok App users) gain exposure to products through trusted creators and enjoy a direct path to purchasing.\nSellers benefit from engaging TikTok-style shoppable content via creators and a pay-for-performance model without significant upfront costs.\nCreators benefit from high potential for performance-based compensation and diverse collaboration opportunities with sellers to promote products.\n\nAffiliate Collaborations\n\nOne of the most basic ways to monetize through affiliates is through direct affiliate collaborations between sellers and creators. There are 2 kinds of collaboration modes in the TikTok Shop Affiliate program:\n\nOpen Collaboration\nAn Open Collaboration refers to a collaboration model where a seller enrolls products into an Open Plan, making the products available for all TikTok Shop Creator Affilitates to see on the Creator Marketplace.\nYou can think of an Open Collaboration as a club which is open to creators, the only requirement being that the creator has registered and is approved to be a TikTok Shop Creator Affiliate.\nIn some cases, sellers can require approval on an Open Collaboration. This means the Open Collaboration is visible to creators but they must apply and pass seller approval to participate. You can think of this as a club bouncer giving partygoers a quick vibe check.\n\nTarget Collaboration\nA Target Collaboration refers to a collaboration model where a seller enrolls products into a Target Plan, making the products available only to TikTok Shop Creator Affilitates that are explicitly invited by the seller.\nYou can think of a Target Collaboration as a club which is invite only. Creators can only get into the club if they are invited by the seller. Once inside, creators must abide by the club's rules and can be removed at anytime.\nTarget Collaborations are a great way for sellers to find creators that suit the seller's unique voice on TikTok, and typically involve creators who have proven themselves through historical performance or possess a strong content portfolio, often carrying higher commission rates.\n\n💡What this means for stakeholders? Development Partners can leverage from these collaborations by potentially charging a SaaS fee to sellers or creators, or by taking a cut of the matchmaking efforts outside of the TikTok Shop platform directly with the seller or creator.\n\nAffiliate Partner Campaigns\n\nAffiliate Partner Campaigns refers to a collaboration model where TikTok Affiliate Partners (TAPs) help sellers and creators matchmake more efficiently. This model is very similar to sub-affiliates in the traditional affiliate marketing space, with TAPs acting as sub-affiliates, referring the best-fit creators to sellers.\nContinuing off the analogy above regarding clubs, you can think of a TAP as a club promoter - someone who knows which club is best for whom. Club promoters have a pulse on the local club scene, including the age group, DJs, music genres, trends, and overall vibes.\nIn the context of TikTok Shop, TAP can recommend viral TikTok trends, products, and help both sellers and creators succeed at creating content for the social commerce era. Some examples of TAP initiatives include creator monetization apps, creator or influencer marketing platforms, sub-affiliates etc.\n\nThe nature of Affiliate Partner Campaigns differs slightly based on the region.\n\nUS/EMEA: One(TAP)-to-one(seller) campaigns are the norm. This is no different from an Open or Target Collaboration, except that the TAP facilitates the matchmaking process, thereby taking a cut off the commission. You can think of a TAP as a sub-affiliate network.\n\nRest of world: One-to-many campaigns are the norm. TAPs often design campaigns that allow for collaboration with multiple TikTok Shop sellers and creators under one broader campaign initiative. These campaigns are geared towards TAPs supporting multiple brands at once, and provide flexibility in commission structures:\n\nEnables third party commission sharing (payout to both TAP and creators upon sales)\nDifferent customization levers around commissions\n\nDespite the differences, commission sharing is a universal feature across all Affiliate Partner Campaigns. It is key to how TAPs monetize their efforts.\n\n💡What this means for stakeholders? TikTok Affiliate Partners (TAPs) that are API-enabled can now efficiently manage Affiliate Partner Campaigns through automation by using these APIs. Essentially, Affiliate Partner Campaigns function similarly to Open or Target Collaborations, except that TAPs can directly monetize off the transaction. If you are a partner that prefers to monetize off SaaS fees or other means, we recommend that you leverage from the Open or Target Collaboration model.\n\nTikTok Shop Partner Center Policies\n\nhttps://partner.tiktokshop.com/docv2/page/6506bbf2de672602b7bc0697"

    "title": "Affiliate API overview",
    "content": "📌 Note: Affiliate APIs are currently not available in the UK and EU markets.\n\nContext\n\nDevelopment partners can integrate with the TikTok Shop Affiliate APIs to help TikTok Shop stakeholders create, manage, matchmake, track, monetize, and collaborate across TikTok Shop Affiliate Collaborations and Partner Campaigns. Listing an Affiliate API integrated app within the TikTok Shop App Store offers development partners numerous advantages:\n\nSupport for Existing Customers: Satisfy and support your existing customers who are already on TikTok Shop or will be joining soon.\n\nIncreased Exposure: Gain visibility among TikTok Shop sellers looking for affiliate solutions within the app store.\n\nMarketing Opportunities: Benefit from inclusion in marketing initiatives related to the TikTok Shop App Store.\n\nCompetitive Differentiation: Stand out from competitors that are not integrated with TikTok Shop.\n\nEnhanced Revenue Generation: Provide a down-funnel, measurable solution that focuses on performance and revenue generation, beyond just top-of-funnel awareness and engagement marketing.\n\nTypes of Affiliate APIs\n\nThere are 3 types of APIs available for affiliate management:\n\nAffiliate Seller API: Help sellers maximize product visibility through open and target collaborations with TikTok Shop Creator Affiliates, facilitate seamless product promotion, and track the overall conversions from their affiliate marketing efforts.\n\nAffiliate Creator API: Help TikTok Shop Creator Affiliates manage their collaborations and product showcases on TikTok Shop, while also tracking the conversion from their marketing efforts.\n\nAffiliate Partner API: Help TikTok Affiliate Partners (TAPs) effectively manage campaigns that match-make sellers with TikTok Shop Creator Affiliates, optimizing product promotion for sellers while offering enhanced monetization opportunities for TikTok Shop Creator Affiliates.\n\nDevelopment partners can use a combination of these APIs to:\n\nEnroll seller's catalog into open collaboration\n\nCreate open collaboration\n\nCreate target collaboration\n\nCreate partner campaign\n\nHelp sellers find creators\n\nand more...\n\nImportant Concepts\nTikTok Shop Affiliate Program\n\nThe TikTok Shop Affiliate Program consists of Affiliate Collaborations and Affiliate Partner Campaigns, both of which allow sellers and TikTok Shop Creator Affiliates to collaborate and build the next era of social commerce based on engaging shoppable content on TikTok.\n\nTikTok Shop Creator Affiliates are creators that are eligible to sell e-commerce products on TikTok Shop. To be eligible, creators need to fulfil these requirements:\nRegistered in the US, UK, and SEA\nUS: 1K+ followers\nUK, SEA: 5K+ followers\n18+ years old\nNo more than 3 violations on their account\n\nCreators can apply to be included in the affiliate program here.\n(Henceforth, TikTok Shop Creator Affiliates will be generally referred to as creators.)\n\n📌 Note: Currently there is no way for external partners to facilitate or moderate creator onboarding programmatically. We will improve upon this in a future iteration, but for now, you can check whether a creator is a TikTok Shop Creator Affiliate in 2 ways:\n\nThe Creator has a \"Showcase\" icon on their profile\nThe Creator is able to successfully authorize the partner\n\nNote that TikTok Shop Creator Authorization is currently separate from TikTok for Business or TikTok for Developers.\n\n\n\nShoppable content in the context of TikTok Shop refers to engaging TikTok videos created by creators, where they tag seller products within the videos and embed native anchor links that allow the end-user to directly shop on the creator's content. Key characteristics of e-commerce based on shoppable content:\n\nUnlike traditional e-commerce affiliates (links, coupon codes, social media redirects), this type of content eliminates issues with attribution and cookie durations since users engage and purchase without navigating away from the app.\n\nIt enables straightforward and performance-based monetization, eliminating ambiguities often found in traditional marketing approaches. Creators earn a commission (determined by the seller) on the purchases they directly drive (no view attribution), while sellers receive the remaining payout from the sales after taxes and fees.\n\n💡What this means for stakeholders?\n\nBuyers (TikTok App users) gain exposure to products through trusted creators and enjoy a direct path to purchasing.\nSellers benefit from engaging TikTok-style shoppable content via creators and a pay-for-performance model without significant upfront costs.\nCreators benefit from high potential for performance-based compensation and diverse collaboration opportunities with sellers to promote products.\n\nAffiliate Collaborations\n\nOne of the most basic ways to monetize through affiliates is through direct affiliate collaborations between sellers and creators. There are 2 kinds of collaboration modes in the TikTok Shop Affiliate program:\n\nOpen Collaboration\nAn Open Collaboration refers to a collaboration model where a seller enrolls products into an Open Plan, making the products available for all TikTok Shop Creator Affilitates to see on the Creator Marketplace.\nYou can think of an Open Collaboration as a club which is open to creators, the only requirement being that the creator has registered and is approved to be a TikTok Shop Creator Affiliate.\nIn some cases, sellers can require approval on an Open Collaboration. This means the Open Collaboration is visible to creators but they must apply and pass seller approval to participate. You can think of this as a club bouncer giving partygoers a quick vibe check.\n\nTarget Collaboration\nA Target Collaboration refers to a collaboration model where a seller enrolls products into a Target Plan, making the products available only to TikTok Shop Creator Affilitates that are explicitly invited by the seller.\nYou can think of a Target Collaboration as a club which is invite only. Creators can only get into the club if they are invited by the seller. Once inside, creators must abide by the club's rules and can be removed at anytime.\nTarget Collaborations are a great way for sellers to find creators that suit the seller's unique voice on TikTok, and typically involve creators who have proven themselves through historical performance or possess a strong content portfolio, often carrying higher commission rates.\n\n💡What this means for stakeholders? Development Partners can leverage from these collaborations by potentially charging a SaaS fee to sellers or creators, or by taking a cut of the matchmaking efforts outside of the TikTok Shop platform directly with the seller or creator.\n\nAffiliate Partner Campaigns\n\nAffiliate Partner Campaigns refers to a collaboration model where TikTok Affiliate Partners (TAPs) help sellers and creators matchmake more efficiently. This model is very similar to sub-affiliates in the traditional affiliate marketing space, with TAPs acting as sub-affiliates, referring the best-fit creators to sellers.\nContinuing off the analogy above regarding clubs, you can think of a TAP as a club promoter - someone who knows which club is best for whom. Club promoters have a pulse on the local club scene, including the age group, DJs, music genres, trends, and overall vibes.\nIn the context of TikTok Shop, TAP can recommend viral TikTok trends, products, and help both sellers and creators succeed at creating content for the social commerce era. Some examples of TAP initiatives include creator monetization apps, creator or influencer marketing platforms, sub-affiliates etc.\n\nThe nature of Affiliate Partner Campaigns differs slightly based on the region.\n\nUS/EMEA: One(TAP)-to-one(seller) campaigns are the norm. This is no different from an Open or Target Collaboration, except that the TAP facilitates the matchmaking process, thereby taking a cut off the commission. You can think of a TAP as a sub-affiliate network.\n\nRest of world: One-to-many campaigns are the norm. TAPs often design campaigns that allow for collaboration with multiple TikTok Shop sellers and creators under one broader campaign initiative. These campaigns are geared towards TAPs supporting multiple brands at once, and provide flexibility in commission structures:\n\nEnables third party commission sharing (payout to both TAP and creators upon sales)\nDifferent customization levers around commissions\n\nDespite the differences, commission sharing is a universal feature across all Affiliate Partner Campaigns. It is key to how TAPs monetize their efforts.\n\n💡What this means for stakeholders? TikTok Affiliate Partners (TAPs) that are API-enabled can now efficiently manage Affiliate Partner Campaigns through automation by using these APIs. Essentially, Affiliate Partner Campaigns function similarly to Open or Target Collaborations, except that TAPs can directly monetize off the transaction. If you are a partner that prefers to monetize off SaaS fees or other means, we recommend that you leverage from the Open or Target Collaboration model.\n\nTikTok Shop Partner Center Policies\n\nhttps://partner.tiktokshop.com/docv2/page/6506bbf2de672602b7bc0697"
